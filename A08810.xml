            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>HRISTIAN Reader, there came forth of late an injurious Pamphlet, entitled <hi>A juſt complaint againſt an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt doer;</hi> wherein is proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the world, <hi>The miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſlavery &amp; bondage of the Engliſh Church at Amſterdam:</hi> and the blame of this miſery is layd upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, as being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by my <hi>tyrannicall government &amp; corrupt doctrine &amp;c.</hi> Heynous accuſations denounced as with ſound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet from an high pinacle of the Printers Tower, and blowen abroad into many Countries. My hope and helpe againſt this tempeſtuous blaſt, is in that our mercifull and faithfull Advocate, who pleads the cauſe of his ſervants, and brings forth their righteouſnes as the light, and their judgements as the noone day.</p>
            <p>To conſider who have bene the ſpeciall Actours in this work, may give ſome light unto the Readers for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcerning and judging thereof. For as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> in his Proteſtation ſayth, <hi>he knew not neither could imagine what motive ſet this Publiſher upon this work, unleſſe he knew the man:</hi> So when the Readers ſhall in ſome part know the <pb facs="tcp:1262:3"/> perſons that have bene the chief

               </gap>, they may in ſome part know or imagine what motive did ſet their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented humours upon this ſcandalous enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>The Printer hereof <hi>Sa. St.</hi> that left out his name in the title-page, did yet of himſelf voluntarily acknowledge that which he had done therein. Now he being a Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, no marvell if he had a hand therein.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that framed the Title, who did alſo make the concluſion of this book, having a hand either jointly or ſeverally, both in the beginning and end thereof, are by their owne confeſſion knowne to be Browniſts, <hi>I.C.</hi> and <hi>S. St.</hi> It is not ſtrange that theſe men for the furtherance of their owne cauſe, ſhould encourage theſe complaina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts againſt me, and as it were clap them on the ſhoulder, and ſay unto them in their concluſion, <hi>ſtand faſt therefore, quit you like men in ſtriving for the maintenance of this part of the faith, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The principall Publiſher hereof, that ſought help of the Browniſts, &amp; cauſed it to be printed, is found to be <hi>Wi. Be.</hi> the foreman of the ſubſcribers, who though in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription he have the foremoſt ſtanding, yet that he is one of the leaſt underſtanding among them, appeareth by his raſh proceedings in this buſines. The Printer of the Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts noted him to be a <hi>Simplician,</hi> when he would not otherwiſe expreſſe his name. And well might they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him a ſimple Perſon, that would ſuffer them to have a hand both in the Title &amp; concluſion of his booke, he not perceaving the evill thereof. <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> himſelf deciphers him as <hi>an iniurious one, a ſower of diſcord, and a buſy body in other mens matters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt part of the Pamphlet was made by <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenp.</hi> conteyning a threefold writing, partly againſt the Claſſis, &amp; partly againſt me, ech of them having his name ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed thereunto.

               </gap>s it ſeemeth) diſcontented that his calling among us did not ſucceed, and comming neerer unto the Browniſts in this queſtion about baptiſme then unto us, it is therefore the leſſe marvell that he alſo had a hand in writing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints againſt me for not deſiring him.</p>
            <p>The two Perſons of truſt, of whom <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> ſpeaks in his Proteſtation, to whom he committed his writings for the ſatisfaction of others, before they were printed, are unknowne unto me, otherwiſe then by conjecture. His ſecret friends that are my ſecret enimies, doe yet walk in the dark.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part of the Pamphlet is ſubſcribed with the names of many perſons among us, all of them ſpeciall friends of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> that have made it their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint and proteſtation againſt me; though many others among us doe utterly diſlike and diſclayme that which is done by them. Divers of them having formerly bene Browniſts, and left their ſeparation to come unto us, doe yet ſhew hereby that they ſtill cleave too much unto ſome of their opinions. And for ſome others of them, I wiſh that they had not ſhewed ſo much affection and reſpect that way.</p>
            <p>The Perſon that brought theſe complaints into ſuch frame and method, doth yet lurke in darknes, as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſuch a work, neither is he yet certainly knowne. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the ſubſcribers themſelves doe profeſſe, that they know not who wrote them, and ſuch as doe know, doe yet hide the ſame.</p>
            <p>One <hi>fore-reader</hi> of the complaints to ſuch as met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the houſe of <hi>N.I.</hi> for the ſubſcribing of them, is confeſſed to be <hi>Io.

               <pb facs="tcp:1262:5"/> Might they not well have ſuſpected the matter, to ſee ſuch an inſtrument employed in the buſines?</p>
            <p>The Title of the Pamphlet is, as I heare, generally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked by the ſubſcribers &amp; complaynants themſelves, and by ſome of them condemned as a vile Title. But the truth is, As is the one, ſo is the other: If the complaints be juſt, then is the Title juſt, being framed according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents &amp; ſpeciall ſubject of the book: if the Title be a vile Title, then is the book alſo as vile; neither have I ſo much cauſe to complaine of the Browniſts that made the Title, as of them that made the book. If this Church be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of that liberty and power which Chriſt hath given it, &amp;c. If the Elders be deprived of their power in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for the good of the Church, &amp;c. If I have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Church under the undue power of the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, &amp;c. If theſe and the like aſſertions in their book be true, then is the Title and ſuperſcription as lawfull as the ſubſcription; then is there cauſe to complaine of <hi>the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſlavery and bondage</hi> of this Church, and of <hi>Tyrannicall government, &amp;c.</hi> Then is there cauſe to commend &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the liberty and freedome of the Browniſts, which are not ſubject unto the power of any Claſſis or Synod, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the government of other Reformed Churches. And then (if theſe complaynants had by the Word of God ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifyed their complaints) it were reaſonable that all the ancient churches of God in Europe ſhould come to theſe complaynants, and learne of them their new forme of government.</p>
            <p>But I finde no juſt ground that theſe oppoſites bring for their complaints, nor any due proofe of their many reproofes: therefore though I be covered with reproach by them, I doe yet comfort my ſelf in the Lord. That which ſome will have to be <hi>the ſlavery and bondage</hi> of a Church, that I eſteeme to be the liberty, ſafety and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Churches. That which they count a <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall <pb facs="tcp:1262:5"/> government,</hi> that I beleeve to be a Sanctuary againſt Tyranny. That
<hi>ſingle uncompounded policy</hi> (as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iacob</hi> calles it) whereby particular Congregations are made to be independent, not ſtanding under any other Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall authority out of themſelves, that I conceave to bring with it manifold diſorders, confuſion and diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Churches. For the teſtimony of this truth, I am not aſhamed to ſuffer that reproach which ſome lay upon me. Though I have already bene ſmitten on the right cheek, yet am I ready to turne the other alſo, rather then to forſake this truth, which I judge to be of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Yea if I were caſt upon my death-bed, ready to deliver up my ſoule into the handes of the Lord, I ſhould judge it to be my duety, and a ſpeciall fruit of my love and care for the flock of God, among my laſt words to warne them of theſe things, as now I doe. And for theſe my oppoſite brethren, I deſire they would be like-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that laying aſide all prejudice and inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they would ſuffer themſelves to be better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in theſe things, wherein they have bene evidently miſtaken through want of due circumſpection; that they would labour to doe thoſe things, which God would have them to doe, and whereof they are to give an account un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, they know not how ſoone.</p>
            <p>It cannot but be greevous to ſee contentions abound and overflow, to ſee enimies of the Church inſult and hardned in ſchiſme and errour; yet is not the truth to be betrayed or neglected. Nature and Religion teach men to anſwer for themſelves when they are accuſed, and to make a defenſive, when others make an offenſive war. The ſtate of Churches at this day is like unto <hi>a glaſsy Sea mingled with fire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 15.2.</note> with fire of fervent contentions at home and abroad, yet even there doe the faithfull ſtand with the Harpes of God rejoycing in the profeſſion of that truth, which is oppugned and contended againſt. As for <pb facs="tcp:1262:6"/> my ſelf, how unjuſtly ſoever I am dealt withall in this kinde, being called as it were to the publick barre of a generall judgment before the world, and accuſed before all men, in this day of man, yet while I learne thereby to judge my ſelf, ſtriving ſtill, and more then formerly, to be further of from the evilles unjuſtly imputed unto me, my hope is that the Lord will doe me good by theſe wrongs, and that I ſhall reape ſuch fruit, as ſhall encreaſe my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the day of the Lord. And as for others, one ſpeciall fruit that I exſpect from this controverſy, is that thoſe which are wiſe and godly, will hereby take occaſion to thinke more ſeriouſly of theſe things, taking heed what new formes of Churches and Church-government they frame unto themſelves, or commend unto others. For theſe my oppoſites I wiſh unto them, that as ſome of them have already diſcerned their fault in this unadviſed ſubſcription, that ſo the reſt alſo following their example, may come to the ſight and confeſſion of their errour, and thereby finde true reſt and peace unto their ſoules. The God of glory, that brings light out of darknes, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter love of truth from ſight of dangerous errours, guide us by his Word, and illuminate us by his ſpirit, to diſcerne the things that differ, and to follow that which is good, to ponder the path of our feet, and to turne neither to the right hand nor to the left.

                  <p>The condition of thoſe complaynants is deſcribed by the title of <hi>the burthened and oppreſſed:</hi> but in ſtead thereof they might much more juſtly have ſtiled themſelves the burtheners and oppreſſours, and this both in reſpect of me and of themſelves. They burthen me with a load of ſlanders in the ſeverall parts of this their writing, as will appeare in the anſwer thereof: ſo that as the Lord complayned of ingratefull men,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>I am preſsed under you as a cart is preſsed that is full of ſheaves,</hi> ſo may I complaine of their preſſing me with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches. The fitteſt title for this their writing might have bene this, <hi>The cart-load of reproches.</hi> They burden themſelves alſo and are guilty of their owne oppreſſion, when in this writing they complaine of being ſubjected unto the undue power of the Claſſis: for were they not under the wings of this authority and power of the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, they would be deprived of that helpe and refuge which the Claſſis affoordeth unto thoſe that are burdened and oppreſſed in a particular Congregation.</p>
                  <p>Moreover it is to be obſerved how theſe complaynants intitling themſelves indefinitely <hi>the burthened and oppreſsed members of the <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1262:8"/> Engliſh Church,</hi> doe herein ſpeake ambiguouſly, and the words may be ſo underſtood, as if the body of the Church were here meant by the members of the Engliſh Church. But in ſuch a meaning their words are notoriouſly falſe. Theſe 21 ſubſcribers are not the Church, but a faction in the Church, and the greateſt part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation (ſo far as I heare) doe complaine of theſe complayners.

                  <p>The time of their writing theſe complaints was <hi>Anno
1634. Octob. 18.</hi> For the yeare it was a time when the Churches of God were in great affliction, by the oppreſſion of Antichriſt, the enimy prevayling ſo much in Dutch-land. And theſe judgments of God abounding in ſuch meaſure neere unto us, might have reſtrayned theſe men from ſo inſolent an enterpriſe in ſuch a time. For the day of the moneth it was unto me a day of mourning, when God had taken out of this world a godly member of our Church, and my faithfull ſervant, who being dead and yet unburyed, and my ſelfe alſo weake and ſickly,<note place="margin">

So was Chriſt

                        <hi>Mark.</hi> 15.36.</note> and the ſervant is not above his Lord.</p>
                  <p>I have a long time, with great patience borne many reproches; but now being ſo heynouſly accuſed, and ſo vehemently urged by the importunity of theſe brethren that have made this moſt unreaſonable and unjuſt writing againſt me, I ſhould betray mine owne innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and prejudice both the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and the worke of my miniſtery, which God hath committed unto me, if I ſhould not give anſwer unto them, and make an Apology for my ſelfe, as diverſe worthy ſervants of God in like caſe have done. And yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I take liberty to my ſelf to ſpeake freely unto my oppoſites in ſhewing them their tranſgreſſion, my purpoſe notwithſtanding is by the grace of God not to doe the leaſt wrong unto them, for the greateſt which they have done unto me. And to this end, I beſeech his heavenly Majeſty to guide me with his Spirit in all and every one of my anſwers, that I may not erre from this marke which I have ſet up unto my ſelfe:<note place="margin">

9 that are formoſt in the ſubſcription; of the ſecond, thoſe 12 that ſubſcribed laſt. To the firſt ſort in the firſt place, I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for thoſe plauſible ſpeeches, &amp; pretences of Reverence to the ordinance of God, they are ſuch as that the Browniſts themſelves will ſay as much even in the midſt of their ſeparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They will be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to profeſſe that they <hi>doe not ſeparate out of any contempt or ſleight ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Lords ſupper, the free injoyment whereof in a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they account an especiall priviledge, and whatſoever hindreth them from it a very grievous affliction.</hi> Thus far the Browniſts may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge by their owne principles touching their ſeparation one from another: and what ſingular thing have theſe complaynants then ſpoken in excuſe of themſelves?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From excuſing of themſelves they proceed to the accuſing of me, and complayne that <hi>the ſinfull proceedings of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iohn Paget have deprived them of ſo great a benefit at that time.</hi> But had theſe complaynants well conſidered their owne wayes, and the way of truth, they would then have left the complaint upon themſelves, and upon the proceedings of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iohn Davenport.</hi> As for themſelves, it is their ſlander of me, which they can never proove, that I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived them of the benefit of the Lords ſupper. And as for <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport,</hi> he is guilty of nouriſhing contention in our Church, while <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1262:9"/> thoſe rootes of bitternes and evill weedes of unjuſt complaints are watered by him: whiles he himſelfe by his writing which was firſt ſecretly ſpread abroad among our people, doth make the like yea &amp; many the very ſame complaints that theſe men have. Hereby they are confirmed in their murmurings, and their hands are ſtrengthened unto evill.<note place="margin">Booke of Complaints p. <hi>12.</hi>
                     </note> His pretence of care to preſerve my peace and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, cannot excuſe him: he ſayth of our Church, <hi>had he not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed much patience and induſtry, it would certainly have fallen from me, &amp;c.</hi> But as he doth vainly praiſe himſelf and wrong me, ſo doth he notoriouſly diſhonor and wrong the body of our Church, of which he ſpeakes indefinitely without exception. For
1. he doth hereby accuſe our Church generally to be of a ſchiſmaticall diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either through their blindnes, or of a malicious purpoſe, in being ſo ready to break communion, and to rend themſelves from their Paſtour. His folly &amp; vaine credulity is the more in that he avoucheth this with ſuch a peremptory aſſeveration, <hi>certainly they would have fallen from him.</hi> The untruth of this his aſſertion appeareth in the greater part of the congregation, by the teſtimony of their reſpect unto me, and of their hatred of ſchiſme, witneſſed partly by their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent attendance upon the miniſtery of the Word, and partly by their ſpeeches otherwayes. 2. For theſe complaynants themſelves though in their haſt and diſcontentment, they might happily have threatned to leave communion, and to forſake the Church, yet is it not credible, eſpecially for the greater part that they would have bene ſo wicked and ſcandalous as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> would have us to beleeve. And even theſe 9 that abſtained lately from the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for once, doe here in this place ſeek to excuſe themſelves for it, when they ſay that they durſt not approch to the Lords ſupper, <hi>till they had in ſome meaſure diſcharged their duetyes, &amp;c.</hi> which ſeemes to import they had no abſolute purpoſe of making a rent. 3. His vaine glory in this confident aſſeveration is ſo much the greater, in that he arrogates unto himſelf the hindring of them from ſo great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, aſcribing it to his owne great patience and induſtry; and that otherwiſe they would certainly haue done it. What is this els but to magnify himſelf with the diminiſhing of the grace and power of God; as though God had not other meanes enough without <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

To come neerer unto the ſpeciall point of the controverſy, it is a defective and too ſhort a rule of keeping communion, which they note in ſhewing their judgement that <hi>the perſonall ſin of any man cannot defile the ordinances of God unto us, if we be meet, &amp;c.</hi> for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>the perſonall ſin</hi> of any man, nor yet the ſinnes and corruptions which are in the very eſtate of a Church, in the miniſtery, offices, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, government and order thereof, can defile the ordinances of God unto us, ſo long as we our ſelves doe not practiſe and act evill, nor give any approbation thereof.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi>
1.6.8 <hi>with Mat.</hi> 15.6.9.</note> For as formerly in the Church of the Iewes, ſo now preſently in diverſe true Churches, beſides the perſonall ſins of men, there be many corruptions in the miniſtery, order and government thereof, and yet are not the ordinances of God therein defiled unto ſuch as doe their duty in their owne eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewing and witneſſing againſt evill.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If this rule were not defective, it could not (according to their profeſſion) be any juſt excuſe or warrant unto theſe complaynants of keeping communion in our Church: for they doe not onely accuſe me of perſonall ſin, but ſhew that the very eſtate, order and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1262:10"/> of our Church is corrupt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If the Church be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of that power which Chriſt hath given it in the free choyce of their Paſtour; if the Elders be deprived of their power in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; if the Church be by me ſubjected unto an undue power of the Claſſis, as they complaine; then is the very eſtate of our Church an enthralled eſtate, wanting the liberty &amp; power of Chriſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if either my perſonall ſin, or if the publiq corrupt eſtate of our Church could defile the ordinances of God unto them, then could they not keepe communion with us, But I ſuppoſe it is their uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that made them or their ſcribe to alledge this inſufficient rule of keeping communion, rather then their adviſed and ſetled judgment.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If theſe complaynants be willing to beare their blame (as they profeſſe here) when their ſin is prooved unto them out of the word of God: then let them looke upon theſe words of God, where he ordeyned by Moſes, that<note n="*" place="margin">

If men have neglected their duety for reforming of evill in others unto the very day of communion in the Lords Supper, and time permit not then to complaine, what remaines then to be done? ſhall men with theſe complaynants leave the communion for that time, and ſo adde to their former neglect a new offence and ſcandall? we have no ſuch rule or commandement from God: but the negligent are to be humbled in ſoule preſently before the Lord, and pardon is <pb n="10" facs="tcp:1262:11"/> to be deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p n="8">8. When men pretending to teſtify againſt evilles, in ſtead of juſt complaints doe bring reproch and ſlanders, and complaynts of that which is good and lawfull, then in ſtead of clearing themſelves they are more polluted.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iames</hi> 3.6.
<hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15.</note> Their owne tongue defileth them. And that this is the caſe of theſe complaynants, once guilty for their forſaking of the communion, and double guilty for their teſtification afterwards, the ſequel will plainly manifeſt.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Whereas they tell, how they <hi>waited that ſome thing ſhould have bene done by others, but in vaine, &amp;c.</hi> what they meane hereby I know not, except it be of the Elderſhip calling upon them to ſhew the reaſons of their abſence from the Lords Supper, of which they ſpeake alſo. Now although no man can excuſe his owne neglect of duety by wayting on others, yet the waiting of theſe men in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, cannot be ſayd to have bene in vayne: for had they not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it by bringing this their writing, it was agreed in the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that in their viſitation before the time of the next following communion, they ſhould have bene ſpoken unto touching the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their abſence. And this might have bene done by the Elders, though I was not able through weaknes at that time to have gone about with them.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Above others <hi>William Best</hi> who is the foreman in this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, hath the leaſt colour of excuſe for his offence and diſorder in leaving the communion: for he having bene with the Elderſhip before, and made knowne his complaints both by word &amp; writing; ſuppoſe his complaint had bene juſt, what needed he now to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelfe for feare of partaking with thoſe ſins, againſt which he had ſo ſolemnely teſtifyed already? It ſeemes he was more forward then others to complaine, and yet more ignorant then the reſt of the nature of lawfull communion.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Seeing <hi>W.B.</hi> could thus finde an opportunity to come unto the conſiſtory, and there to diſcharge his imagined duety, by ſhewing his grievances and complaints both by word and writing, and was <pb n="11" facs="tcp:1262:11"/> thereupon preſently informed touching his duety in the conſiſtory, and afterwards viſited by me at his owne houſe, and conferred againe withall for his further information: why might not any one of theſe 9 complaynants have done the like? Hereby it appears how unjuſt that part of their complaint is, when touching ſuch opportunity they ſay, that <hi>formerly they could not obtaine it.</hi> For why might not each of them have taken their deſired opportunity as well as he, and in ſuch manner as he did, before any diſcommunion had bene made by them? But in this alſo he is moſt of all to be blamed, that whereas he actually had this opportunity, and full liberty of declaring his minde, he not onely abſented himſelfe, but alſo ſets his hand and ſubſcribes his name to this complaint as well as others, as if he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly have obtained that, which he know that he had.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The offence of <hi>L. C.</hi> being a Deacon of the Church, is alſo the greater in this regard, not onely in leaving the communion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he was bound as a Chriſtian, but alſo in leaving his ſervice and attendance upon the Lords table, whereunto he was bound as a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, and which he was wont to performe with the reſt of the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons. Every evill example of ſuch an one becomes a greater ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block, doth more hurt to others and procureth more blame to themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. It is to be obſerved that the 9 firſt are condemned by the 12 latter ſubſcribers, who though they joyne with the firſt in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, yet did not joyne with them in the ſchiſme, but kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves pure from the ſcandall of ſeparation. If theſe 12 did lawfully in communicating with us, then did the other 9 unlawfully in refuſing of communion. If they will not learne of me, yet let them receive inſtruction from their owne fellowes.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Before the 9 ſeparatours had reſolved upon a matter of ſo great danger in forſaking the table of the Lord, eſpecially if they had beene ſo <hi>deeply and inwardly grieved,</hi> as they pretend, for looſing ſo great a comfort of the Lords Supper, then it had bene meet for the preventing both of their owne grief and others ſcandall, that they ſhould have taken adviſe of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

                  <p n="15">15. As for the 9 in regard of communion; ſo in regard of the complaints following, godly wiſedome &amp; good conſcience required of them all, both of the 9 firſt &amp; 12 latter complaynants, that they ſhould have the counſell of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

When I was yet a childe, before I was 12 yeares old, I felt this impreſſion &amp; this ardent affection to that calling; and that for this cauſe to inſtruct the people of God, and to ſhew the way of life unto others, and not for the proffit or preferment ſake to be obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereby. That ſmall patrimony &amp; inheritance of free land which belonged unto me, I ever deſpiſed, &amp; was conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſpoſed of for the comfort ſake which I exſpected from this calling. And for theſe 38 yeares &amp; upward, wherein I have already continued in the miniſtery, I am privy to my ſelfe that this deſire hath remayned in me even to this houre. And therefore how weak ſoever my labors have bene, yet doe I aſſure my ſelf, that I have not bene deluded with the vaine title and ſhadow of a Miniſter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whatſoever inward deſire I had to the work of the miniſtery yet I never ſought the place of a Paſtour, till I was lawfully called: did not intrude nor thruſt in my ſelf for a Paſtour; neither did I ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> before I was ſent. I went not to fill up the place of a Paſtour upon diſordered ſending for by ſome particular perſon without know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge of the reſt, but wayted for an orderly election, and call by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:1262:15"/>3. Being ſetled in this calling, I have not wanted a comfortable experience of Gods bleſſing upon my labours. God that worketh by weake meanes, hath oft ſhewed his grace and power in my great weaknes. I will not ſpeake further hereof what I juſtly might, nor ſhew the ample teſtimony which formerly hath bene given unto me in other places. Onely yet let me remember the teſtimony of ſundry theſe my oppoſites, and that at ſuch time when they were offended with me, when there was controverſy about <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hooker.</hi> In their proteſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> caryed to the Claſſis by 2 Elders, 2 Deacons, and 2 mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church in the name of divers others. In that writing they teſtify thus much; <hi>for ſo much as concerns M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget our teacher, we acknowledge that his life and doctrine is ſuch, that (without flattery it is ſpoken) we can have no better, who hath continued with us now 20 yeares and more, and hath obtayned great praiſe with us, and with all that know him.</hi> And this was written in the name of the Conſiſtory and of the members of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whatſoever troubles have befallen me in this calling; whatſoever dangers I have undergone for teſtifying againſt the corruptions of the times and places where I lived; yet did I never voluntarily deſert or forſake that worke of miniſtery which was committed unto me. The feare of perſecution hath not cauſed me to make a reſignation of my place, nor to looke back whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I had put my hand to this plough of the Lord. And my reſolution ſtill is by the grace of God to cleave unto Chriſt, to take up his croſſe and to follow him; and ſo long as it pleaſeth the Lord to graunt me life, ſtrength and liberty, to ſerve him in the Goſpell of his Son, to preach the glad tidings of ſalvation unto the contrite, and to call men from the paths of errour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Whereas theſe importunate complaynants doe tell us further in this writing, that they doe <hi>by theſe preſents testify unto all men, &amp;c.</hi> Though this their writing be vile and moſt unworthy to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed unto a few, much leſſe unto all men: yet ſeeing the matters of theſe complaynts are already for the moſt part ſpread far &amp; neare, before this their writing was made, I am therefore content to joyne with them therein, deſiring that this my Apology or Anſwer may go as far, for the ſatisfaction of all men, to whom either theſe their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1262:16"/> ſhall come, or their other former reproches haue already come.</p>
                  <p>Whereas they adde that they teſtify this, <hi>principally to the Elders of this Church,</hi> it is no marvell that they ſhould dedicate this their writing unto them, ſeing ſome of theſe Elders are parties with them, and that in divers poynts as is after to be ſhewed: Neither can I give a full anſwer unto this their writing in ſundry particulars thereof, but that I am to reprove the Elders as well as them. Thoſe to whom I principally intend this anſwer, are ſuch as be abuſed with untrue and unjuſt complaints already blazed in ſo many places; and among theſe I ſuppoſe, are divers of theſe complaynants themſelves, who being miſled by others without due conſideration of that which they have done, by the help of this my anſwer may come to the ſight of their errour and wrong done unto me.</p>
                  <p>But leaving their preamble and generall propoſition, let us now come to the particulars, whereby they would prove that I doe not behave my ſelf as becommeth a Paſtour, neither in government nor doctrine.</p>

               <p>THat he doth it not in governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, will appeare in theſe particulars. First he depriveth the Church of that liberty and power which Christ hath given it in the free choyce of their Pastour, contrary to Act. 6. v. 3. &amp; 14. v. 23.</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>FIrſt of all, it is to be obſerved that in this heynous accuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they doe not onely accuſe me, but the Miniſters of theſe Reformed Churches alſo, and ſpecially thoſe to whom we are neereſt united in this Claſſis, under which we ſtand, whoſe order and practiſe in the choyſe of Miniſters I doe for my part labour to follow ſo neere as I can: &amp; therefore through my ſides they wound a multitude of others. Yea the perſons themſelves are not ſo much taxed hereby, as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry government &amp; order of diſcipline eſtabliſhed in theſe Churches. It is untrue which they ſay, that I deprive the Church of her power: if the Church be ſpoyled of the power that Chriſt gave, this is not to be imputed unto me, ſeeing this order was here in theſe Countries eſtabliſhed before my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming unto them: neither is it in my power to alter &amp; change the forme of their government.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:1262:16"/>Secondly, behold the partiality of this accuſation. The order ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved among us in the choyce of Miniſter, Elders and Deacons is that practiſe wherein the whole Elderſhip together with the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons have had their hand joyntly ſo well as I. If the order obſerved be unlawfull and contrary to Act. 6. &amp; 14. then are they guilty of thoſe diſorders &amp; defiled with the tranſgreſſion of thoſe Scriptures as well as I; ſeing they have ſtill joyned with me in ſuch elections. And how unreaſonable a thing is this, that the blame of ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding which is common to many ſhould be layd upon me alone?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſuppoſe they had indifferently accuſed the whole Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip together with me for depriving the Church of her power, yet what is the reaſon that they never framed ſuch an accuſation &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation before this preſent; ſeeing this practiſe hath continued among us from time to time ſo many yeares, even to the laſt election of Elders and Deacons this laſt yeare, againſt which no ſuch excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made? why have they ſlept ſo long, and who hath wakened them at this preſent? How have they beene meet partakers of the Lords Supper, and preſerved themſelves from partaking in other mens ſins according to their former pretence, while they have not ſought reformation of this imagined evill? I leave it to their owne conſciences to conſider, whether now alſo they would not have kept ſilence, if they could have brought in <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> even according to this corrupt order uſed by us as they complaine of it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To come neerer unto the conſideration of theſe places, <hi>Act. 6.3. &amp; 14.23.</hi> I acknowledge (as I have alſo divers times pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blikely taught in the expoſition of theſe 2 places) that the free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the people is required unto the lawfull calling of a Miniſter: neither is the ſame denyed or excluded in our practiſe. The Synods of theſe reformed Churches deſcribing the order to be obſerved in the calling of Miniſters, doe require a choyſe to be made by the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Deacons, approbation of the Magiſtrates, allowance of the Claſſis, &amp; in the laſt place conſent of the Congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before whom the names of the perſons called are publikely propounded from the Pulpit divers Lords dayes, that they may take knowledge of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; witnes their conſent or diſſent as they ſhall finde occaſion. This is the order of theſe Churches &amp; this is our practiſe, and therefore it <pb n="20" facs="tcp:1262:17"/> is a falſe accuſation of ſuch as affirme the people to be deprived of their power hereby.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, whereas ſome object from <hi>Act. 6.3.</hi> that the people ought to goe before in ſeeking out officers for themſelves, that is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to be examined by us. To this end it is to be conſidered, 1. That the Scripture makes no mention of eitheir teaching or ruling Elders ordeyned at that time when the Deacons were firſt choſen <hi>Act. 6.</hi> If there were at that time no Elders, how could they then goe before the reſt, as now they may doe in thoſe places where they are? 2. If there were no Elders then, yet the Apoſtles that were then preſent may juſtly be accounted preſidents going before the people in that action in ſtead of ordinary Elders. For though the multitude of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples being many thouſands at that time, be ſpoken unto for ſeeking out of Deacons, yet is not the precedency of the Apoſtles excluded thereby, and it is partly expreſſed, in that they preſcribed both the thing to be done, the number of perſons to be elected, and the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of them. 3. Suppoſe the Apoſtles had wholly withdrawne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from that buſines of nomination and election of Deacons, yet were there many excellent men full of the Holy Ghoſt at that time; ſuch as had bene the Diſciples of Chriſt before his death; ſuch as had receaved extraordinary gifts of the Spirit; ſuch as Barſabas, Barnabas, Stephen and others, who then in all reaſon were to goe before the reſt in guiding the action in ſtead of Elders; according to that<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.9.10.</note> example in the Scriptures, where that is aſſcribed unto the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, which of neceſſity was to be performed by ſome chiefe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons going before the reſt with their conſent. 4. That other place, <hi>Actor. 14.23.</hi> where the act of electing is attributed unto Paul and Barnabas, although the conſent of the people be ſhewed thereby, yet doth it withall imply ſuch an order, that they went before others as leaders therein. That one<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:1262:17"/>Sixthly, unles the meaning of that place
<hi>Act. 6.3.</hi> be thus expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; determined by conference with other Scriptures, men might hence take occaſion to run into ſuch uncouth abſurdities as by the relation of one of theſe complaynants, were committed in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence at the confirmation of a certain Engliſh Miniſter in theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where the women being required &amp; called upon to that end, did lift up their hands for teſtimony of their conſent in calling him to be their Miniſter. For it is ſayd that the<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 6.2.3</note> multitude of Diſciples were called together about the election of Deacons, and required to looke out fit perſons for that office; and<note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 6.7. <hi>with Act.</hi> 9.36.</note> women being in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture called Diſciples &amp; reckoned among them, might hereby ſeeme to have a hand allowed them in this worke, ſave that in<note n="*" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12.</note> other places there is a reſtraynt to exclude them from ſuch acts of power, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might overſway the voyces of men.

Thus alſo might that infamous and ſcandalous action of <hi>T.F.</hi> &amp; <hi>E.S.</hi> in going about to houſes, gathering and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe the names of ſuch women and maydes as gave not their conſent to the calling of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

                  <p>Seventhly, if theſe complaynants were ech of them apart well exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined touching the due order of elections, and touching the ground thereof from theſe places <hi>Act. 6. &amp; 14.</hi> I doe aſſure my ſelf that very few of them would be found to agree with one an other. It is very probable that they neither vnderſtand themſelves, nor one an other, but are caryed blindely &amp; inconſiderately in theſe great and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant charges. A notable evidence hereof we have had already about the gathering of the names of women &amp; maydes by <hi>T.E.</hi> &amp; <hi>E.S.</hi> to oppoſe the election of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. B.</hi> for at that time when many of the theefe of theſe complaynants,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iun.</hi> 25. 1633.</note> viz.
<hi>T.F.A.H.I.C.H.D.I.S.D.B. I.P.H.P.</hi> &amp; others, came together to the conſiſtory, at that time, there was this remarkable diſſention and difference among them, in three kindes. Some of them acknowledged that they did not allow <pb n="22" facs="tcp:1262:18"/> that women ſhould have voyces in the election of Miniſters: Some of them profeſſed they could not tell what to judge thereof: Some of them in defence thereof alledged the judgement and practiſe of certain Miniſters for the conſent of women. Might not this example have brought them to ſome feeling of their ignorance &amp; vanity, and have made them to abſtaine from ſuch peremptory charges &amp; accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, as they have now preſumed to make in this their writing?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly to deprive the Church of that liberty and power which Chriſt hath given it in the free choyſe of Miniſters, muſt needs be an heynous crime &amp; no leſſe then ſacriledge. And the guilt thereof doth involve not onely the principall agent, but all that are any way acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary thereunto, even thoſe that receave a calling from a Church, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that power which Chriſt hath given &amp; ordayned for the calling of officers. Now if their accuſation be true, concerning the enthralled eſtate of our Church deprived of their power &amp; liberty by me, then ſee how theſe blind accuſers, not to ſpeak of others among us, doe enwrap not onely other Elders and fellow Deacons, but themſelves alſo in the ſacrilegious crime of entring into their callings, not by the right dore of a free choyſe according to <hi>Act. 6. &amp; 14.</hi> but by a backdore or poſterne of unlawfull intruſion without free conſent of people, which they ſay is wanting among vs. For both <hi>W.

If I be guilty of robbing the Church of her power, theſe alſo muſt be theeves in receaving that which I ſtole. Neither can it help them to ſay, that their accuſation is about the choyſe of a Paſtour, ſeeing Chriſt hath appointed but one order for the choyſe both of Paſtour &amp; Deacon. And the place alledged by themſelves
<hi>Act. 6.</hi> ſpeaks more expreſly and immediately of Deacons then of Paſtour. Thus the heat of their fiery contention is ſo vehement, that it burns themſelves; as once the mighty men of Babel were conſumed by the flame of that fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry furnace,<note place="margin">

But I ſpare to ſpeake of many things too long to be related, which might be of uſe for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of this ſlander. 2. It is yet to be obſerved, how to make up their accuſation againſt me, they rake into this buſines that fell out above 20 yeares paſt.

For howſoever I acknowledge, he hath written divers learned &amp; worthy treatiſes of much good uſe for the Church of God, and many doe juſtly rejoyce and give thanks for his labours: Yet this opinion and practiſe according to it, could not chooſe but procure (in my judgment) great confuſion &amp; diſturbance of Churches. And how then could I, or any that ſo judgeth, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intertayne ſuch an occaſion of contention &amp; ſcandall?

And beſides this, (not to ſpeake of other things) he was generally held to be a man fitter to be a Profeſſour of Divinity in the Schooles, and that his gift was rather Doctorall then Paſtorall. And when he left his profeſſion in the Univerſity, it was generally diſliked of all learned men (ſo far as I could heare) <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1262:21"/> throughout theſe countries, none that approoved him therein. Such alſo as were ſuppoſed to be occaſion of his removall, were much blamed for it; and had I done it, I ſhould have borne a blame even for this alſo; for calling him from the Academy, where the Curateurs were ſo unwilling to leave him.</p>

                        <hi>Anno</hi> 1610</note>For <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Forbes,</hi> About ſome 24 yeares paſt, there was a motion of calling him to be Miniſter among us. One cauſe of ſtay was this: He being baniſhed out of Scotland, becauſe of the Declinatour or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, which he &amp; ſome others made from certaine civill judges unto the generall Aſſembly or Synod, as onely judge competent in ſuch an Eccleſiaſticall cauſe as was in queſtion; Hereupon aroſe ſome que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion betwixt us, I thinking ſuch an appeale to be unlawfull, and he on the other ſide not onely ſought to maintaine it, but avouched alſo that the oath of ſupremacy touching the Princes power in Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall cauſes, which the Miniſters of England, whether conformiſts or non-conformiſts doe all take, was an unlawfull oath. Upon this I was mooved to enter into a more ſerious conſideration, both of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale &amp; of my owne oath, &amp; deſired of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Forbes</hi> that there might be a meeting of Miniſters for the hearing of this difference, offering to ſhew unto him before them the unlawfulnes of his Appeale. But this offer he abſolutely refuſed: and hereupon not onely I, but all our Elders with one conſent, ſeeing he refuſed to give us ſatisfaction, did alſo refuſe to proceed in the calling of him. And was this my offence? was it to deprive the Church of that power which Chriſt gave unto it?</p>
                  <p>For <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Peters,</hi> Though at his firſt comming I gave ſome way and oppoſed not ſuch as ſought to have him here: Yet after ſome time of his continuance in the country, when he was called, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed for Paſtour of the Engliſh Church at Rotterdam; when after this a new proportion was againe made for calling him hither, I acknowledge that I did not conſent unto it. And I thinke it needles to give a reaſon here, why I gave not my voyce for him: but I doe yet thinke it needfull to enquire of theſe complaynants theſe 2 things; 1. Who be their witneſſes of my oppoſing <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Peters,</hi> for hereby it ſeemes that ſome ſitting among us, haue unlawfully divulged this, which ought to have bene concealed, and that this accuſation is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from the ſuggeſtions of ſuch as it leaſt becommeth. 2. This alſo would be demanded of them, why their complaint is ſo partially di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected againſt me alone, ſeeing there were others in the Conſiſtory <pb n="29" facs="tcp:1262:21"/> beſides me, which did likewiſe oppoſe the election of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

                  <p>OUr Saviour teacheth us in doing good, to give good meaſure,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.38.</note> preſſed downe, ſhaken together, and running over. In ſtead hereof theſe accuſers in doing evill unto me, fill an Ephah with ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; hereof they give a large meaſure, preſſed downe, ſhaken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and running over, as appeareth in this ſection.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a ſlander that <hi>I preſſe others upon the Congregation;</hi> ſeeing in this act of election I uſe no power, but of giving my voyce or ſuffrage as the reſt doe: other authority I doe not arrogate unto my ſelf: I doe not clayme unto my ſelf any more then one voyce. Every Elder &amp; Deacon hath in like manner a voyce as well as I, in the free choyſe of Miniſters or other officers. If they conceave any errour to be committed in the election, they have equall liberty and power to ſeeke redreſſe by the ſame ordinary &amp; lawfull meanes as well as I.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is an other vile ſlander, when they ſay, <hi>I abuſe my interest in the Magistrates &amp; Claſſis to that purpoſe.</hi> It had bene requiſite that theſe accuſers ſhould have brought their witneſſes for proofe of this charge. But loe in ſtead of proofe we have nothing but their bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word, which is not to be admitted.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a further ſlander, preſſed downe in their meaſure, which doubles their guiltines, in that they ſpare not to involve the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in the ſame crime with me. If I procure them &amp; prevayle ſo far with them, that the Church be thereby deprived of that liberty <pb n="30" facs="tcp:1262:22"/> and power that Chriſt hath given it, for the free choyſe of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to which purpoſe this is alledged; then are the Magiſtrates alſo guilty in ſuffring themſelves to be abuſed and corrupted by me or others for me: and this not in a ſmall matter, but in ſacriledge and. Church-robbery, in taking away that power which Chriſt gave. Thus to make me a deceaver, they make them Tyrants, and ſo that they may wound me, they care not to ſhoot them thorow alſo with the arrows of their ſlander.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Their ſlander is yet the greater &amp; the meaſure thereof ſhaken together, when they extend it unto the Claſſis alſo, unto the faythfull and godly Miniſters, both in the City and Country adjoyning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as if they were generally ſo blind and corrupt as to ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be abuſed by me, and to be caryed away even unto ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge alſo to deprive the Church of her liberty &amp; power. So that they may fall upon me, they ſpare neither Civill nor Eccleſiaſticall eſtate, they neither honour Magiſtrates nor reverence Miniſters. That they may make me vile and filthy, it is here evident, that they ſpare not to caſt the mire and dirt of their reproches into the faces of principall men, both in Church and commonwealth. Who would thinke that <hi>W.B. I.Po. T.Fl. Th.Fa. I.Cr.</hi> and their fellows ſhould exalt themſelves to ſuch a height of pride in bold ſlandering? <hi>I.S.</hi> in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall being a publiq Notary, whoſe worke is to write downe the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of witneſſes, and ought to know that matters are thereby confirmed; how is it that he ſets his hand unto ſuch a ſlanderous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, both of Magiſtrates &amp; Claſſis abuſed by me, and led unto ſo great ſacriledge, and this without pregnant witnes, or if they have ſufficient witnes, why did they never bring the ſame unto me for my conviction before this time?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is to be obſerved how in the mids of their ſlander, their very reproch it ſelfe ſerves to the clearing of me; for if I have ſuch intereſt both in the Magiſtrates &amp; Miniſters of the Claſſis, and can ſo much prevayle with both, as they here doe write; may not thoſe that are unpartiall, and wiſe in heart conceave hereby, that I have obtayned this intereſt in them, not by abuſing &amp; corrupting them, but rather by walking uprightly before them, and approoving my wayes in their ſight?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That which the Magiſtrates have done is this: After the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hooker,</hi> calling for me &amp; two of our Elders, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <pb n="31" facs="tcp:1262:22"/> us to proceed without delayes unto the choyſe of ſuch a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter as ſhould accord with the Claſſis, they required alſo that if it were poſſible, ſuch an one ſhould be called which could ſpeak dutch, giving this double reaſon thereof; that both he might be fit to ſit in the Claſſis where the affaires of the Church are debated in the Dutch tongue, and that he might be the mouth of the Church unto the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates upon occaſion as neceſſity ſhould require in thoſe things that were to be treated of with them. And ſince alſo they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that we ſhould chooſe one out of theſe countries neere unto us, rather then to ſend into England for one, giving likewiſe this double reaſon thereof; that both they might better informe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves touching the ſtate of the Miniſter that was to be allowed by them; and becauſe it would be a greater repulſe &amp; trouble unto the Miniſter, ſent for ſo far out of England, if it ſhould fall out that they did not like him nor admit of him. Let reaſonable men judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be ſuch abuſe, and ſuch <hi>unspeakable injury</hi> as theſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers complaine of, upon this act of the Magiſtrates: eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that a Miniſter called unto this place, which cannot ſpeake Dutch, is in great meaſure no better then a dumb Miniſter in reſpect of one ſpeciall worke of his calling, which is to give adviſe for the greateſt difficulties in the government of theſe Churches, in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meetings of the Claſſis.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Notwithſtanding this charge given by the Magiſtrates, yet when <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> was come out of England, although not lawfully ſent for, though he could not ſpeake Dutch, yet when there was hope of his accord with us, upon interceſſion of the Dutch Miniſters, who were informed that he agreed with them, the gentlenes and equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity of the Magiſtrates was ſuch, that they were content to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe with his want of the Dutch language, and for ſupply of our neceſſity to allow of him. But finding after that they were deceaved in him, that he did not reſt in the adviſe of their Miniſters, and that great contention was thereupon rayſed among us, what wonder if they renewed their charge more ſtrictly then before?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, behold here the greateſt ſlander of all, and the meaſure of their ſlander running over; whiles in their raſh judgment and ſinfull taking of the name of God in vayne, they make him a party &amp; an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary againſt me, by affirming that <hi>the Lord hath fought against my courſe hitherto, &amp;c.</hi> for whoſoever in their unjuſt contentions do <pb n="32" facs="tcp:1262:23"/> make the Lord an enemy where he is not, and to fight againſt ſuch as he doth not, they doe reproch the Lord himſelfe, and lay iniquity upon the Lord, making him a partaker with them for maintenance of their ſinne. Their proofe that the Lord hath fought againſt me, is from
<hi>the great unfitnes of thoſe who have preached here by my nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or conſent in ſending for.</hi> But this maine proofe is many wayes to their owne juſt reproofe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt that preached here by my conſent in ſending for him, though not by my nomination was <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Balmford,</hi> and this after the charge given by the Magiſtrates. His great unfitnes is their great ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that avouch it, unleſſe they could proove it. How ſome of theſe complaynants fought againſt his calling is notorious through the country, to the ſhame and reproch of our Church.</p>
                  <p>The next that preached here by my conſent in ſending for, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with conſent of the Elderſhip, is a man endued with ſpeciall gifts of learning, piety and utterance, adorned with the teſtimony of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men in thoſe parts where he lived; and it is another notable ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſpeake of his great unfitnes. Such reproches are quickly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, but the guilt of them is not ſo quickly and eaſily taken away.</p>
                  <p>The next that preached here, for whom I have borne many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches, before this accuſation was written, is a man alſo of ſpeciall note for his learning and labours in the Church of God, and much commended unto us by divers men of eſteeme. Howbeit there was none that made ſo much ſcruple in ſending for him as I did; neither did I at all give my voyce unto him, but being overſwayed by voyces, I yeelded at their deſire to write unto him in the name of the Elders and Deacons, and ſubſcribed it as a witneſſe of that which the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip deſired, which was onely to heare him and to take tryall of his gifts. It may here be obſerved what double &amp; treble injury is done unto me in this buſines, 1. how unjuſtly I am dealt withall by them that tell abroad, and that ſo falſely the things that are done in the Conſiſtoty. 2. How partially I alone am blamed for that which others did, and I leaſt of all contented unto. 3. How unjuſtly I am blamed for that, which is abſolutely lawfull, namely to take tryall of mens gifts, knowledge and utterance, howſoever they proove upon tryall; for he had no calling, but was onely ſent for that we might heare him &amp; confer with him. How ill adviſed then have theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playnants bene, upon ſo weak a foundation to build ſo haynous an <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1262:23"/> accuſation that God hath fought againſt me?

               <p>WHiles I was buſy in writing downe my anſwer unto theſe complaynts, it is given me to underſtand, that an other complaint is written againſt me by <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> and ſecretly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed among our people. Having gotten a copy thereof, I finde that he hath dealt very injuriouſly with me, not onely in miſreporting many thinges, but in ſundry unjuſt inferences and reaſonings which he makes thereupon. I finde alſo that moſt of his complaints are for the ſubſtance of them, the very ſame that theſe complaynants have framed againſt me, as if they and he had ſpoken out of one mouth, or as if the ſame pen had written both. His writing is threefold, and <pb n="34" facs="tcp:1262:24"/> each of them hath his name ſubſcribed. The firſt is his Letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the Claſſis, tranſlated out of Latine into Engliſh: The ſecond an inſtruction given unto ſome of our Elders: The third is a new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition unto the former, both againſt me and the Claſſis alſo. Ech of theſe three writings are ſtayned with untruth, and matter of reproch, and are fit to kindle contention in our Church, and to harden theſe complaynants in their unjuſt oppoſition, not againſt me onely, but againſt the Claſſis and the governours of theſe Churches; which is a very evill office, and far unbeſeeming a Miniſter of the Goſpell, and ſuch an one as is ſo eminent &amp; renowmed in the Church of England. Therefore before I proceed further in the refutation of theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playnants &amp; their objections, I haue thought it needfull to ſet downe a ſhort ſtory or narration touching the calling of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> and the iſſue thereof, which may ſerve to give light unto this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, in ſtead of ſo many broken and falſe relations, which here and there are made to my prejudice, and ſerve to darken and obſcure the truth. His two former writings for the full anſwer thereof, I doe for this preſent leave unto the conſideration of the Claſſis, unto whom they were given, to deale therein as ſhall be judged moſt convenient: For the third writing, I purpoſe now to anſwer it in every particular thereof; yet ſo as I ſhall take them in by the way, and inſert them (as I have already begun) into that anſwer which I make unto theſe complaynants, in ſuch place and upon ſuch occaſion as I ſhall judge the fitteſt, ſeeing they all may be referred eitheir unto this ſtory, or unto one or other head of their complaints. Yea and for the matters of fact conteyned in his former writing to the Claſſis, becauſe ſome of them are the very ſame which theſe complaynants doe object, therefore can I not altogether paſſe by them without ſome touch thereof.</p>

<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> himſelfe had done more wiſely, if before his comming he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with us. Now notwithſtanding this diſorderly and unlawfull <pb n="35" facs="tcp:1262:24"/> manner of ſending for, without my knowledge, and without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or knowledge of our Elderſhip; yet being come out of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, I made no exception hereat for the ſtay or hindrance of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. I deſired him to preach and entred into deliberation how to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his calling. But this <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> in his third writing perverteth to ſhew that I did not deſire to have him,
<hi>becauſe</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>ſeverall times he ſhewed his diſlike of my comming hither without his deſire, or conſent in ſending for me, though it is apparant that God ſent me hither at a needfull time, when without me they would have bene destitute, he being unable to preach or to come unto the Church.</hi> Hereunto I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He doth untruely and unjuſtly relate my ſpeeches, by leaving out the ſpeciall cauſe of my diſlike: he ſpeakes onely of my deſire &amp; conſent, which was wanting in his ſending for; whereas I ſpake how he was ſent for without my knowledge, and without the knowledge or conſent of our Elderſhip. And who ſees not how great a difference there is betwixt my words and his miſreport of them? If the matter had bene communicated with the Elderſhip, and if his ſending for had bene allowed of the moſt, his comming over upon ſuch a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, might have bene lawfull and juſt, though my deſire or conſent had bene wanting, but to ſend for him without my knowledge, and without either conſent or knowledge of the Elderſhip, this was the thing I ſhewed my diſlike of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When at ſeverall times upon occaſion, I ſhewed my diſlike of the diſordred courſe in ſending for him, and yet in ſuch manner, that at the ſame time I ſtill ſhewed withall, that this diſorder ſhould not hinder me from furthering his call, and that I would not take any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception thereat, if he did otherwiſe accord with us; this is a plaine proof that I was willing enough to have him with us, and his contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inference from hence is vayne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though in regard of Gods providence which extendeth it ſelfe unto all things, good or evill, <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> might ſay he was ſent of God in a needfull time, when I was ſick; yet this is no warrant or excuſe at all for that diſorder uſed in ſending for him: for God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſendeth wicked men and wicked ſpirits in needfull time, to accompliſh his will, and to ſerve his providence, both for deliverance of his people and for puniſhment; and yet thoſe wicked inſtruments that were ſo ſent of God, are not excuſed thereby.

               <p n="4">4. It is apparent that <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> his not-comming in the needfull time, was one ſpeciall meanes of my ſicknes: for upon the report &amp; exſpectation of his comming, there grew a neglect in time to provide other meanes for ſupply of my place the Lords-day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his comming, thereupon being fruſtrate of that exſpectation, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the place ſhould be deſtitute, I ſtrayned my ſelfe above my power, not being fully recovered, and ſo the ſame evening of that day, I got a dangerous relapſe, and my ſicknes was renewed through his occaſion, whereby we were diſappointed. Otherwiſe there was great appearance of my ſpeedy recovery.

               </head>
               <p>HAving paſſed by this diſorder of ſending for him, there was alſo another difficulty, which I did not inſiſt upon, as I might have done, if I had bene ſo deſirous to hinder his calling as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends; for though it be neceſſary that thoſe which leave a Paſtorall calling, ſhould bring authentiq teſtimony of their lawfull dimiſſion, before they be admitted to take upon them the like charge in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, yet neither did the want of this, cauſe me to make any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay in the calling of
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

But it doth not appeare from hence, that I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched juſt againſt his reſignation of his place, the manner whereof I knew not; no more then I intend to ſpeak againſt the perſon of ſuch or ſuch a particular ſinner, when I preach againſt the ſpeciall ſinnes that are common in the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas he addes touching his reſignation, that <hi>I afterwards justifyed it, when he related unto me the cauſe thereof, the carying therein, and the conſent of many worthy divines, and of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelfe thereunto.</hi> The truth is, as I remember, that I did approove of divers particular things, which he told me that he had done in that buſines, which I conceaved to be ſo as he related, yet did I not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abſolutely juſtify his reſignation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Herein appeared that I was willing enough to admit of him, in that I did not enter into a ſtricter examination of theſe two things; firſt of his evidence, to ſhew that both theſe Divines and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation did clearly conſent unto his reſignation; and ſecondly of the groundes whereupon they conſented, which were needfull to be knowne, with ſome other things alſo that belong unto ſo great and weighty a matter, as that was; eſpecially conſidering that worthy Divines are ſometimes miſtaken in ſuch queſtions, and juſtly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by others.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Suppoſe that I had preached againſt his reſignation, yet would not this juſtify his collection from thence, namely, that I never deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him; for both before I heard of his reſignation, and after againe, if it had bene as he fayth, that I juſtifyed it upon his relation, he might then have conceaved an alteration in me, and ſo not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that I never deſired him.</p>

               <head>Of the knowledge which <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. DAVENPORT</hi> had of our differences before his comming over unto us. <hi>SECT. X.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Davenport</hi> before his comming into theſe Countries, had heard of our troubles and controverſies, and he had heard of the occaſion thereof; he knew what was required of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hooker,</hi> and ſaw in writing a copy of the differences betweene him and us, as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1262:26"/> both <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> himſelfe hath confeſſed and others have teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. He might well thinke that if he brought the ſame opinions with him unto us, he ſhould thereby bring the like troubles, and revive &amp; rekindle that fire that was quenched. If at his comming over he was of the ſame minde with us, how is be ſo ſodainely changed? If he was not of the ſame minde with us, what meant he to come over to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe our peace? If he came with a diſcordant minde, what could he exſpect but new contentions, rents &amp; ſchiſmes about thoſe things, which he knew had occaſioned ſo great diſturbance before?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenports</hi> excuſe touching his knowledge and ſight of the queſtions propoſed unto <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hooker,</hi> is that <hi>he ſaw the questions in London above a yeare before his comming over, when he was far from any thoughts of comming to Amſterdam, or to any place out of his owne Land.</hi> But if he ſaw them ſo long before, he had the more time to deliberate ripely. If he either forgate them, or loſt the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting which was communicated with him, he had oportunity and meanes enough to have got them againe. And when he was by ſome particular friends mooved to come hither, had he not then juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to have conſidered the ſtate of theſe Churches, before he came over to diſturbe their peace by his oppoſition and contrariety unto them? When his thoughts of comming to Amſterdam did ariſe with in him, ought not this care to have riſen up in his heart together, to conſider our eſtate and his owne diſpoſition for agreement with us, leaſt he ſhould adde fewell to that flame of contention, the light whereof hath bene ſeene ſo far of.</p>
               <p>He anſwereth further, <hi>And when he did come over, he purpoſed both in England and here, that he came but for 3 or 4 moneths, for which time what need was there of knowing, much leſſe practiſing or conforming to the Dutch Churches?</hi> But he ought to have conſidered better,</p>
               <p n="1">1. For a man of plauſible gifts, eminent, and of fame, and wanting preſent imployment, to preſent himſelfe where a place is vacant, where much contention hath bene about that place, though he offer to ſtay but for 3 of 4 moneths; who ſees not that ſuch an one doth manifeſtly give occaſion of ſeeking him and calling him unto that place? Divers learned and godly Miniſters being our neighbours in this Countrey, have bene loth to ſhew themſelves in this place, and notwithſtanding their juſt occaſions of comming hither, have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly <pb n="39" facs="tcp:1262:26"/> abſented themſelves a longer time, leaſt they ſhould ſeeme to offer themſelves unto this calling: ſuch was their modeſty and care to avoyd all appearance of intruſion. <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hooker</hi> alſo though ſent for by a private man, yet being come over to Rotterdam, yet there he ſtopt and ſtayed himſelfe, and was not willing to come hither, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had bene ſent for by our Elderſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as ſecretly ſent for <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> and <hi>I.C.</hi> that fetched him over, did they ſeek him but for 3 or 4 moneths? The friend which by an open and unſealed letter, which <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf brought unto me from Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, entreated me to receave
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport</hi> for a fellow-helper, did not deſire that for 3 or 4 moneths onely.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Was it likely that after 3 or 4 moneths preaching among us, he could eaſily be diſmiſſed? And muſt not our labour and care of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and calling another Miniſter, be interrupted for that time, if not wholly broken off?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Suppoſe he purpoſed to ſtay but 3 or 4 moneths onely, yet even for that time it was needfull for him to know the ſtate of the Dutch Churches, and of ours with them, there being ſuch controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies rayſed as he had heard of, and to that end to informe himſelf by inquiry, that being come unto us, he might ſo much the better have applyed himſelfe to doe good. For ſeeing a good conſcience ſuffers not a man to be neutrall, nor to ſuſpend his judgment, when it is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly deſired, but forceth him to beare witneſſe unto the truth, when it is called into queſtion, in thoſe things which he eſteemeth to be neceſſary and agreeable to the will of God; how dangerous then had it bene for <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> not to be well informed of our eſtate, when the members of our Church ſhould require his judgment for their ſatisfaction and help? In
3 or 4 moneths time a man might doe more hurt even by his private conference, then in 7 yeares could be repayred againe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Suppoſe <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> had never purpoſed to have come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe Countries, yet had it bene very needfull and uſefull for him, or any that deſires the reformation of a Church in any Country, to know the ſtate and practiſe of adjoyning Reformed Churches, and that for their help in divers preſent controverſies, which help while ſome have neglected, they have dangerouſly ſtumbled and fallen to the great offence of many.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:1262:27"/>
                  <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> anſwereth yet further and ſayth, <hi>When he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of that question</hi> (touching Baptiſme) <hi>as it was put to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, there was not neither in the question nor anſwer ſufficient light to informe him of that which time hath diſcovered herein, neither can any man from thence know what in this queſtion is to be diſliked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But on the contrary, many men from that queſtion and anſwer might have knowne what was to be liked or diſliked therein, neither is there ſuch obſcurity therein as is pretended. If <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hooker</hi> had not underſtood it, as it was put unto him, he being then in theſe Countries, might eaſily have informed himſelfe further, even the ſame day that it was propounded unto him.

C.</hi> one of theſe chiefe complaynants, being ſometime with him in London could not, yet the Miniſters of the Dutch Church his neighbours in the ſame City, could eaſily have informed him: and if he had not found that ſufficient, yet had it bene ten times better for him to have wayted for a letter of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from hence, either touching that or any other queſtion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the practiſe of theſe Churches, then to have rayſed ſuch broyles and contentions among us by comming over unreſolved to agree with us, and by bringing his diſſention with him.</p>

               <p>BEſide the knowledge which <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

Iohnſon,</hi> Paſtour of the Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, began at length to ſee his errour, and acknowledged his fault to <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport touching this point, but that he refuſed it, &amp;c.</hi> Hereunto I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is untrue that I ſo reported; I know we did divers times confer and talke together about this point, and I know that many others did know it well enough. But this I have ſayd and reported divers times; when after our conference together, ſome of theſe complaynants came unto me, and ſpoke againſt me, and the Dutch Miniſters, as if we had no word of God, but cuſtomes and examples of men for our practiſe, then upon ſuch provocation (as hath bene <pb n="42" facs="tcp:1262:28"/> noted before,<note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note>) I offered unto them,

                  <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> would ſet downe in writing any warrant from the Scripture for his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I would then give him an anſwer in writing, &amp;c. But though this was offred unto them ſundry times, yet did none of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that the queſtion ſhould be in writing diſcuſſed betwixt us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas he ſayth, <hi>there paſſed 2 or 3 ſerious conferences betweene us, wherein this point was diſputed, &amp;c.</hi> I acknowledge that all our conferences were ſerious, becauſe they were not in jeaſt, but that there were any accurate or exact diſputations betwixt us, as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport</hi> ſeemes to ſay, that I deny. And for his part, I doe not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that ever he propounded any argument in maintenance of his opinion, further then to make ſome exceptions upon occaſion of that which I ſpake.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Where he addes touching theſe conferences, <hi>that he hath them in writing by him;</hi> Herein I doe complaine of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> for want of ſincere and plaine dealing; that he ſhould write downe my ſpeeches, and the talke that paſſed betweene him and me, without my knowledge in ſuch a ſtealing &amp; ſecret faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It ſeemes he came prepared ſo to ſpeake, as that he would have his words written, which was far from my thought. I dreamed of no ſuch underhand courſe, but diſcourſed as occaſion was given in that time of my ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, when this was done. Honeſt and upright dealing required that he ſhould have acquainted me with his purpoſe, which had I knowne, I ſhould have condeſcended unto a writing upon equall termes, as willingly as he. It was ſtrange unto me, when I did firſt heare of this by one of our Elders that told me, how he had written downe the paſſages betwixt us, when he departed home from me, and in my heart I loathed ſuch his dealing, which here he is not aſhamed to publiſh himſelfe, ſaying that he hath theſe conferences in writing by him. Had he either given me leave to write mine owne words, and not like a deceytfull Notary, to ſet them downe at home in a corner as he thought beſt: or had he at leaſt ſhewed me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards what he had written, to ſee whether I would have owned th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> betweene him and me, doth give me juſt cauſe of diſclayming and rejecting his apocryphall ſcripture, or hidden writing of his and my words. For in his firſt writing to the Claſſis, he offendeth both in exceſſe and defect; both relating what was not ſpoken, and omitting that which was ſpoken, and needfull to be knowne for the matter in hand. In ſetting downe the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about his examination of parents, he neither reports my que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, nor his owne anſwer rightly and truely. I demanded of him what meaſure of knowledge he would in his examination require in parents for the baptiſing of their children, which queſtion is of great uſe for deciding of the controverſy: but this my queſtion is concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and another fayned in ſtead thereof. His anſwer to my queſtion, which I often and plainly urged him withall, was not as he relates, which is alſo from the point, neither was it ſatisfactory, for he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that meaſure of knowledge required, could not be declared till the time of examining the perſons; that then he ſhould judge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. In the ſame writing alſo he doth make a very defective relation of his anſwer and my queſtion, about his conſent unto the writing of the 5 Miniſters, of which more hereafter. Hereby may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved what impartiality and ſincerity we are to exſpect from his lurking notes of this conference.</p>

<hi>I would ſpeake no more with him alone.</hi> Let the reader know, that I did not give over conference for feare of being convinced by any force of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but ſeeing little fruit of my talk with him, I deſired him to confer with the Dutch Miniſters, that could give him better ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Neither did I then ſay, that I would ſpeake no more with him alone; but afterwards upon his refuſall of the calling, when he came into the Church, and deſired to ſpeake with me alone from the reſt of the Conſiſtory; I required him to ſpeake in their preſence, and refuſed to confer with him alone about that matter, for feare my words ſhould be perverted: and likewiſe when I firſt underſtood how his manner was to write downe my words, when he came home, I then profeſſed unto divers, that it was not ſafe for me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with him alone, unles witneſſes were preſent.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Suppoſe that I my ſelf had never heard him ſpeake any ſuch word; yet when as he upon my demand of his conſent, did refer me for anſwer unto <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

If <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. W.</hi> had ſpoken of himſelfe without ſuch warrant from <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. W.</hi> he thereby gave authority both unto him to ſpeak, and unto me to receave his teſtimony.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I went yet further, for though he had referd me for his anſwer unto <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. W.</hi> yet I told him at the ſame time, that it was better that he ſhould give his anſwer himſelfe; whereupon he ſayd (not as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports in his letter to the Claſſis,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 4.</note> that <hi>the writers themſelves did not require this of him,</hi>) but this he ſayd, he thought the Dutch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters had done as much as they could, and ſo referd himſelfe to that order of the Conſiſtory, which <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. W.</hi> had told him; and <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. W.</hi> being preſent, ſayd unto me, that I needed not to ſpeake further unto him about it.</p>

And therefore when as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary he afterward would not reſt in that writing and order together, both being made for his accommodation, this ſhewes that he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and went back from his anſwer rightly apprehended by me.</p>

When he yet addes touching this order, and the way made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it by the writing and his conſent in that manner, that <hi>I ſhewed my ſelf diſcontented thereat,</hi> it is both untrue, and hath no colour of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it (if he meane that the order was made without my conſent or againſt my will) ſeeing I had a principall hand in the making that order, not onely conſenting, but alſo motioning and propounding it, as is noted in the act, and departing from mine owne right to make the ſame as is ſhewed before.</p>

               <p n="4">4. <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. W.</hi> hath not onely in Conſiſtory teſtifyed this conſent of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> but hath alſo ſayd as much unto ſome of the Dutch Miniſters, when they were intreated to further the calling of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> with the Magiſtrates. Then
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. W.</hi> teſtifyed alſo, that though <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

W.</hi> deny what he hath ſayd, as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> would have it, from thence alſo might he be convicted. By this it may appeare, how untrue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> is, who ſayth afterwards againe, <hi>It hath bene oft cleared, that he miſ-understood that Elder, if ſo he understood him.</hi> For it was never once cleared: but the contrary is cleare and evident by plaine teſtimony, both in and out of the Conſiſtory.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If that which this Elder <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. W.</hi> did ſay, was <hi>onely to quiet M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget,</hi> as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

And hereupon occaſion of controverſy might have riſen hereafter, and the lawfulnes of his calling might have come into queſtion as being procured by deceit and falſe information. Would <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. W.</hi> onely to quiet me, abuſe both Magiſtrates and Claſſis alſo, who likewiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on opinion of his accord with us, did give their conſent for this cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

Who ſees not what an unſufferable abuſe this ſhould have bene, for an Elder of the Church to have dallyed with ſo many perſons, and to have deluded them in ſo weighty a cauſe?</p>

               <p>UPon the conſent of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Davenport</hi> to the writing of the 5 Miniſters, conſidered with the order of the Conſiſtory above mentioned, it was thereupon reſolved that ſome ſhould with the firſt goe unto the Burgemaiſters, to ſeeke their approbation. Hereunto were deputed M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>A.</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. W. together with my ſelf: and though I at that time was very weake, and not fully recovered of my ſicknes, yet above my ſtrength I made divers journeys with our Elders, both unto the Stadthouſe and unto the private houſes of divers Burgemaiſters, to ſeek their conſent for the allowance of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Davenport,</hi> and to further his calling. And ſome of the Dutch Miniſters alſo being informed by ſome of our Elders, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport</hi> reſted in their adviſe, did thereupon make interceſſion to the Magiſtrates for their admiſſion of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Davenport,</hi> which at length they granted with admonition that we ſhould keep corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the Dutch Churches.</p>
               <p>Whereas I have often profeſſed, that I would not have gone to the Magiſtrates to ſeek their conſent, unleſſe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Davenport</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the writing of the Miniſters and their advice, &amp;c.<note place="margin">Book of complaints pag. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Davenport</hi> maketh this inference; <hi>If he would not upon other termes have gone to the Magiſtrate, the whole Congregation and I am the leſſe beholding unto him.</hi> I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Congregation is then beholding unto me, when I ſeek to avoyde diſſention, which is then done, when I refuſe to goe unto the Magiſtrates for their approbation of ſuch Miniſters as would nouriſh <pb n="52" facs="tcp:1262:33"/> diſſention among us, by their different practiſes and diſcord from us and the Claſſis, unleſſe by the word of God we were convicted of our ſinfull courſes, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Davenport</hi> hath not done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our whole Congregation (whereof he ſpeakes) doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that I ſhould goe to the Magiſtrates in ſuch caſe; many have witneſſed the contrary unto me; and ſo far as I can diſcerne, the greater part of our Congregation doe deſire ſuch Miniſters and none but ſuch, as doe accord with the diſcipline and order obſerved in theſe Reformed Churches, and therefore muſt accordingly account themſelves beholden unto me for my labour therein, though M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport</hi> doe not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Obſerve how M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Davenport</hi> is a ſower of diſcord among bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, by ſeeking to implant evill ſurmiſes in the harts of our people, by perſwading the members of this Congregation, ſuch as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to my charge, that <hi>they are not beholden unto me:</hi> and how great an injury is it thus to labour to alienate the affections of a Congregation from their Miniſter?</p>
               <p>The great paines which I tooke in going often to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in time of my great weaknes, this alſo is ingratefully perverted by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Davenport</hi> divers wayes. He ſayth, <hi>it is evident how little I ſpake to give ſatisfaction, and what I ſpake might rather ſerve to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe ſuspicion.</hi> But this is neither evident nor true; and I appeale unto the teſtimony of the Magiſtrates themſelves herein. I propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the matter unto the Magiſtrates, both with ſpeciall commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Davenport,</hi> and with declaration of the ſpeciall neceſſity of our Church. I doe ordinarily uſe the fewer words before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, ſpeaking in the Dutch tongue, becauſe I am not perfect therein. I ſpake the leſſe alſo, becauſe I would not willingly ſpeake more then I conceaved to be true. And our Elders that were with me, ſpake ſo much that I needed to ſpeak the leſſe.</p>
               <p>He ſaith further, that <hi>the Magiſtrate was ſatisfyed by other meanes:</hi> But he ſhews not what thoſe other meanes were, as had bene requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite. And though other meanes did concurre, that ſhould not deface the fruit of my endevour alſo.</p>
               <p>He doth alſo ingratefully inſinuate matter of evill furmiſe againſt one of the Dutch Miniſters, that was entreated by ſome of our El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to make interceſſion to the Magiſtrates for their conſent. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Davenport</hi> ſayth, <hi>It was ſo brought about by one of the Dutch <pb n="53" facs="tcp:1262:33"/> Preachers interpoſing, that the Magiſtrates gave but a conditionall conſent unto his call, and made his conformity to this custome of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous baptiſing, the condition thereof, ſo that now matters were in a worſe ſtate then before.</hi> As though the Magiſtrate could not have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a conditionall conſent, but by the interpoſing of that one Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher; or as though one might not both juſtly in regard of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and yet with unfeigned affection to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Davenport</hi> deſire the conſent of the Magiſtrate, upon condition of his agreement with their Church.</p>
               <p>He is injurious unto me againe, when he ſayth, <hi>It is apparent that if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget was at that time content to have me joyne with him, it was but conditionally, that I would doe whatſoever he or the Claſſis would have.</hi> For though it be reaſonable that I ſhould conſent unto his call upon condition of his accord with me and the Claſſis, yet he overlaſheth and looſeth the reynes unto his tongue, when he ſayth, that he ſhould doe <hi>whatſoever I or the Claſſis would have;</hi> as though his doing of our mere will and luſt in all thinges whatſoever, muſt be the condition of his calling.</p>
               <p>It is yet a further reproch when he ſayth of me, <hi>upon which termes he is content to have others, whom he hath no cauſe to deſire for col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues with him.</hi> So his words are in the printed copy, <hi>to deſire</hi> for colleagues with him. And if ſo they be read, there is a great untruth in them, which he cannot juſtify, by ſhewing that I deſire ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy colleagues, whom I have no cauſe to deſire. In the written copyes which I have ſeene, his words are, <hi>to refuſe</hi> for colleagues with him; and if ſo they be read, they containe a reprochfull ſkorne worſe then the other untruth, by carping at my deſire, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tednes to have others, and ſuch colleagues and upon ſuch termes. But this is unworthy of further anſwer, unleſſe he had ſhewed more plainly what he hath to ſay of thoſe others, whom I doe deſire to have for colleagues with me.</p>

This being done, and the former act confirmed againe, and I promiſing for my part to prevent all further occaſions of offence ſo much as in me lay, and all the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Deacons each ſeverally and jointly promiſing the like ſo much as in them lay, hereupon withall was written downe in the ſame Act a teſtification of the Elderſhip, that this being done, <hi>we are perſwaded no occaſion will befall to work any ſcrupule unto M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

               <p>Whereas I have divers times affirmed and teſtifyed in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, that I had done ſo much in the buſines for the furtherance of

               <p>In his firſt writing, namely his letter to the Claſſis, what untruth there is in his miſreporting of the private conference which he had with me, and other complaints, I have ſhewed before Section 11. and is further to be ſhewed hereafter.</p>
               <p>In his ſecond writing of inſtructions committed to ſome deputed Elders, if he meane any lawfully deputed by the Elderſhip, there is a foule untruth or falſification, both in the ſuperſcription and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription thereof, when he ſayth of thoſe inſtructions, that they were delivered by the <hi>Elders of the Engliſh Church deputed,</hi> for
<hi>M. W.</hi> that brought them, was not deputed by the Elderſhip thereunto, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was any ſuch deputation made in our Conſiſtory.

               <p>In his third writing, after he had in his firſt complayned of me to the Claſſis, to make me odious to them; having in his ſecond writing given inſtructions to ſome of our Elders, to teach them how to fill their mouthes with reproch of me, and how to accuſe me, as well as to excuſe him: he proceeds yet further, and in his third writing he moſt ſtrangely accuſeth me to the other members of our Church, by ſuch an undermining courſe as is fit to ſtirre up and incenſe the Congregation againſt me, by affording unto them matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and giving them opportunity to ſpread abroad, and diſperſe his defamatory writings in ſuch manner as is done.</p>
               <p>In this his third writing pag. 12. there is an unjuſt upbrayding of me for his aſſiſtance of me, with a vaine boaſting of himſelfe, anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered Section 2. and Sect. 8. and 40.</p>

               <p>But ſuppoſe I had not deſired to have <hi>Mr. Davenport,</hi> and that I would in our election of a Miniſter, rather have preferred ſome other before him; muſt this needes be made a quarrell and a matter of contention?

It is certainly a want of modeſty and prudence in him to make ſuch diſputes about his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireablenes; and litle care had he of the edification of our Church, to furniſh them with ſuch reaſons written downe by him, to proove that I deſired him not. Would I follow his example, I might ſet downe 6 new reaſons on the other ſide, to ſhew that I was not bound to reſtraine my deſire to him, but might rather have deſired ſome others. But it becommeth not the ſervants of Chriſt to enter willingly into ſuch diſputes; and I wiſh I had not bene compelled by his importunity to anſwer theſe his complaining reaſons given out againſt me.</p>

               <p>First, when matters have bene referred to the Elders to determine, he hath rejected their counſaile and opinions, ſometimes accuſing them of partiality, ſometimes of inſufficiency to judge, when he thought they would conclude against his purpoſe.</p>

                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>FIrſt of all, the deciſion and determination of matters in our El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip, hath alwayes bene by moſt voyces: If three Elders jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged one way, though both the Miniſters were contrary minded, yet plurality of voyces did ſtill prevaile. I never claymed or uſurped ſuch power to give ſentence of any controverſy by any ſole authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mine; neither doe I ever remember any one reſolution conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded without conſent of moſt. And therefore this complaint is a very unjuſt ſlander.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though I have often and upon occaſion ſtill doe oppoſe the counſaile and opinions of ſome Elders, ſometimes more, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſſe, it followes not that I therefore deprive them of their power in government. I ſhould be baſe man-pleaſer, and no faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervant of Chriſt, if I ſhould not oppoſe, contradict and reject that which I conceave to be againſt right and truth, hurtfull to the Church or to any member thereof.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Elders themſelves in thoſe matters that are brought before us, doe in like manner as they judge beſt, refuſe and oppoſe the counſaile and opinions, both of me and of one an another:
<hi>Will. B.</hi> formerly and <hi>La.

What is it then that blindes the eyes of theſe two complaynants in ſpeciall that from the obſervation of their owne practiſe, they cannot ſee this, that the rejecting of other mens opinions doth not proove a deprivation of power in ſuch? Yea is their any Senate either civill or eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, wherein this refuſall and rejecting of opinions doth not fall out?

                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:1262:38"/>4. For my accuſing them ſometimes of partiality and inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to judge, had theſe complainants noted the particular inſtances, wherein I ſo accuſed them, I ſhould then have given further anſwer. I doe remember that during the controverſy about <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hooker</hi> ſome ſuch thinges have bene ſpoken. What I then ſpake with my reaſons thereof, which I then alledged, I conceave to be juſt, but will not now enter into the large narration thereof, upon ſuch a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall provocation as this is. <hi>He that rehearſeth a matter, ſeeketh ſtrife,</hi> as doe theſe complainants, and eſpecially <hi>Will. B.</hi> that doth hereby violate the agreement made before the deputies of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod and Claſſis, and conſented unto by himſelf that was preſent, by accuſing me of ſuch things as were then ended.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As for our Elders being parties, (not to ſpeake of any other things, then of ſuch as theſe complaynants doe accuſe me of in this their preſent writing) I have juſt cauſe to except againſt them in this controverſy about <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

18. <hi>Febr.</hi> 11. 1634.</note> For as I have ſhewed before, there was an order made in the conſiſtory for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

Davenport</hi> in that which he feared. And I was ſo far from proteſting againſt it, that I was the firſt that propounded the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for any other peremptory order to compell and binde the parents to come unto him, or els by an abſolute denyall to repell their children from baptiſme; I doe not remember that there was any ſuch order agreed upon in the Conſiſtory: neither is there any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in our Church-booke, that either our Elders had ſo agreed, or that I had proteſted therein againſt them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If any ſuch order had bene peremptorily reſolved in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, there had bene juſt reaſon for me to have proteſted againſt it, ſeeing the Conſiſtory neither hath power over thoſe which are no members of the Church, to compell them to come unto the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate examination of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> nor yet ſufficient cauſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive their infants of Baptiſme, ſo long as the ſame parents refuſe not <pb n="68" facs="tcp:1262:41"/> to make publike profeſſion of their faith before the whole Church, according to the forme obſerved in the adminiſtration of Baptiſme.

                  <p n="4">4. If I had proteſted againſt ſuch an order, yet had I not deprived the Elders of their power in government thereby.

                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. IT is untrue that the Elders agreed he ſhould have a yeares time granted. They thought it not expedient to ſpecify the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite time of a yeare; but without limitation they agreed he ſhould have a convenient time. So is it teſtifyed in the records of this Act.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is here to be obſerved, how the affaires of the Elderſhip, which ought to have bene kept ſecret, are unlawfully divulged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the lawes thereof; and that untruely alſo. So was it in the former inſtance about the order taken for examination of parents, both diſorderly and falſely reported abroad, which reports theſe complaynants have unjuſtly receaved againſt me.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a partiall and odious relation of them, when they ſpeake of my binding <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> to the orders and cuſtomes of the Dutch, whereas he could not be bound thereunto by me; neither
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1262:41"/> would I take upon my ſelf to bind any man by my authority: He that is bound in ſuch caſe, muſt be bound by the authority of a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Eccleſiaſticall aſſembly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As for the Elders agreement of an uncertaine convenient time, which might have bene, I know not how long, I did not abſolutely oppoſe it neither, as I might juſtly have done, but thought it not ſafe to conſent unto it without adviſe of the Claſſis, and ſo is my ſpeech recorded in the Act thereof. The reaſons I had were divers, both in reſpect of my ſelfe and the Church. For</p>
                  <p>Hereby, the coard of contention ſhould have bene drawne out, and lengthened among us, whiles matters were kept in ſuſpence, and no concluſion of the buſines.</p>
                  <p>Hereby, in the Conſiſtory, where I had moſt trouble, I ſhould have had leaſt aſſiſtance: no help at all, where I moſt needed it, and the Church alſo: ſeeing he could not ſit with us there, while he had no Paſtorall charge, but muſt have bene a looſe aſſiſtant.</p>
                  <p>Hereby in the adminiſtration of Baptiſme, in ſtead of an Aſſiſtant, I ſhould have had a Reſiſtant: his dayly example in refuſing to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe ſuch as I ſhould, ſerving to ſtrengthen others in their oppoſition and contention againſt me.</p>
                  <p>Hereby ſhould have bene hindred the calling of an other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who agreeing with us, might be a true aſſiſtant unto me.</p>
                  <p>Hereby the Church ſhould have wanted the comfort, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Miniſter lawfully called by vertue of that bond, might have miniſtred unto them, in ſuch viſitations as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> uncalled ſhould not have bene bound unto.</p>
                  <p>Hereby offence might have bene given unto the Claſſis, which had formerly diſallowed ſuch an agreement of the Elders about the entertaining of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hooker,</hi> as a lecturer or aſſiſtant, though not confirmed as a Paſtour among us.</p>
                  <p>And in ſumme I eſteemed this agreement as an act of intruſion for <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> that he having preached ſo long among us, might afterward not eaſily or not without difficulty be diſmiſſed, whether he ſhould then agree with us or not: and ſo had bene no end of diſſention.</p>
                  <p>And though <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> in his writing to the Claſſis doe alſo complaine of me for this very thing,<note place="margin">Book of complains pag. <hi>1.2.</hi> &amp; <hi>8.</hi>

And for this cauſe as he had ſpoken of it in the beginning, and end of his firſt writing unto them, ſo he comes againe the third time in his late poſtſcript, and complaines of the Claſſis,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 9.</note> ſaying, <hi>And who would not have thought that the Claſſis would have approoved of the deſire of the Conſistory, that a yeares time ſhould be granted me for the ends aforeſayd? Yet on the contrary they ſeemed to be offended, threatning to complayne to the Magistrates, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is here alſo to be obſerved, how <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> goes before theſe complaynants, and by his example teacheth them to take up this complaint againſt me. They doe fill the viall of their indignation and contention, out of the ciſterne or lake of his complaints. Hee having three ſeverall times objected it, it is not ſtrange that they ſhould be inflamed, when he ſo often blowes the fire. But why doe they not rather complaine of the Claſſis as he began at laſt? And what reaſon have they to bring ſuch complaints as this, which have bene determined in the Claſſis upon the complaint of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third inſtance which they alledge, is that I would not let
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Weld</hi> preach without leave of the Claſſis, though I profeſſed I had nothing againſt him. Hereunto I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though there was no particular errour which I imputed unto <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Weld,</hi> yet for his behaviour in generall, this was an offence and trouble unto me, and made me the more unwilling to have him preach, being a ſtranger, becauſe he refuſed to declare himſelf, and to ſhew his opinion touching our preſent controverſies: herein I thought he dealt not ſo plainly as he ought to have done for my ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. And ſeeing him moſt familiar with thoſe that were my chiefeſt oppoſites, I feared leaſt he might doe as <hi>M<hi rend="sub">r</hi>. Hooker</hi> had done before, in ſtrengthning and animating them againſt me, by preaching againſt that in the afternoone, which I had taught in the forenoone, viz. by his giving allowance unto private men to preach.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Even that which I did herein was not unadviſed: for going un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Dutch Conſiſtory, which conſiſts of many Miniſters &amp; many Elders, and deſiring their counſell; they though they had no power <pb n="71" facs="tcp:1262:42"/> to judge and determine the matter by their ſentence, being but a member of the Claſſis, as we alſo are, yet they refuſed not to give their counſail unto me, which was that I ſhould bring the matter to the Claſſis; which counſail I alſo followed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When upon further conference with <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Weld,</hi> I perceaved in him a peacable diſpoſition, and conceaved that he would not give offence by his preaching among us, I made the ſame knowne unto the Claſſis; whereupon he was admitted to preach, and my deſire was that he might have done it longer.</p>
                  <p>Such are the inſtances whereby they would proove that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the Elders of their power, and give too litle unto them; let us now proceed unto their next maine complaint, that I give too much power unto the Claſſis; thereby to manifeſt that I doe not behave my ſelf as a Paſtour in the government of this Church.</p>

                  <p>IN this third complaint concerning government, obſerve theſe unconſcionable ſlanders in the propoſition thereof:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a ſlander of the Claſſis, when they charge it with an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or <hi>undue power,</hi> under which our Church is ſubjected. This ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is againſt the very ſtate of government and forme of Diſcipline, obſerved and practiſed in theſe Reformed Churches. Our Church is no otherwiſe ſubject unto the Claſſis, then are all other Churches that ſtand in the ſame combination with us, for their mutuall help &amp; benefit. Accuſers are to bring proofe: if theſe accuſers can bring proofe from the Word of God, then is it meet that the Claſſis and every member thereof ſhould confeſſe their faults, their tyranny, uſurpation, unlawfull dominion and undue power that hath bene exerciſed by them. Then is it meet that this preſent government ſhould be diſſolved, and a new order of diſcipline eſtabliſhed, ſuch an one as <hi>Will. Beſt, Ia. Cr. Nic. Ia. Th. Fl. Aug. Hor. Ioſ. St.</hi> and their companions can ſhew unto us out of the Word of God. But this is their double guiltines; they are too haſty and quick in accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <pb n="72" facs="tcp:1262:43"/> and too ſlow in prooving. They ought to have deferred their accuſation, till they had brought their proofes from the Scripture with them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is another ſlander when they ſay, that <hi>I have ſubjected</hi> this Church under an undue power of the Claſſis; that
<hi>I have brought</hi> it under &amp;c. That power which the Claſſis exerciſeth is ancient; the ſame power which they had long before I either knew them or they me; the ſame power which hath bene determined, limited &amp; agreed upon in many nationall Synods of old. And as for me, if I had the will, yet have I no power to be the author of ſuch an exployt as they doe here aſſcribe unto me.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a further ſlander and unjuſt ſurmiſe, when they ſay of me, that I have done this <hi>merely for mine owne ends.</hi> The pureſt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteſt men on earth, have their mixtures of the fleſh with the ſpirit, defiling their beſt works; but to ſay of this imagined enthralment &amp; ſubjection, that I have done it, and this onely or <hi>merely for mine owne ends,</hi> as if they were ſuch perfect diſcerners of the thoughts &amp; intents of the hart, this is a great arrogancy, and a ſetting of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Gods ſtead, whoſe peculiar it is to ſearche, and to judge the hart and reynes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the power of the Claſſis be <hi>an undue power,</hi> as they ſay, then would I faine know of them, what that <hi>due power</hi> is, by which they would have the Church to be governed, unto which they would willingly be ſubjected. For my part I could never yet come to the knowledge thereof by any of them. Is it that power of popular government exerciſed among the Browniſts, ſo as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Aynſworth</hi> maintayned it? Or is it that power of an Elderſhip, which <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> taught without any Claſſis? Or is it that kinde of ſingle uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded policy, which <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iacob</hi> required? Or is it any new un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne forme of government, which they have found out? If they can ſhew us what it is, and agree of it among themſelves, and ſhew further that it agrees with the Word of God, then as they deſired their complaints againſt me might be regiſtred, with place left for the names to be ſubſcribed, that after times might know what evilles they had teſtifyed againſt: then I ſay, they may as well deſire, that their exployt may be recorded, that their 20 names may be regiſtred, that after times may know who the perſons were, that above other learned men have found out where <hi>the due power</hi> of the Church is.</p>

                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:1262:43"/>Let us heare their inſtances to declare how I ſubject this Church to the undue power of the Claſſes.</p>

                  <p>IN this inſtance there be alſo ſundry bold and rude ſlanders,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In ſaying, I give them power to ſerve my ends in keeping out any Miniſter, &amp;c. The power which the Miniſters of the Claſſis have, is not of my gift; they had that power which they exerciſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was. And if by giving of them power, they meane that I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove their power; yet that alſo is ſlanderous in making my appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of them, to be an inſtance and evidence of my ill-governing the Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In this accuſation they are notorious ſlanderers of the Claſſis, in making them no better then theeves, unlawfully receaving that power, which I unlawfully give unto them, as if they were my vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalles and bondſlaves to ſerve my luſts. If it were true which theſe immodeſt accuſers doe ſuggeſt in this writing, then where ſhould men finde either more baſe flatterers on the one ſide, or more cruell tyrants and oppreſſours on the other ſide, then are the Miniſters of this Claſſis, that like blinde unconſcionable judges, for my pleaſure, by my ſuggeſtions, for cauſes pretended by me, to ſerve my ends, ſhould deale ſo unrighteouſly, with ſo eminent and godly men, by executing their undue power upon them? As Herod to kill one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, ſpared not to kill a multitude of other infants: ſo theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playnants that they may undermine me, and blow up me into the ayre, they care not, nor ſpare not with the gunpowder of their fiery contention and reproches, to blow up with me a multitude of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and godly Miniſters, being of the ſame judgment and practiſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">

                        </gap>;</hi> it appeares to the contrary, that they did not abhorre ſchiſme as was meet. Not <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hooker;</hi> whiles he maintayned that ſuch of the Browniſts, as perſiſted in their ſchiſme or ſeparation from the Church of England, might lawfully be receaved of us for members of our Church:</p>
                  <p>Whiles he would not diſallow ſuch of our Church, as went to heare the Browniſts in their ſchiſmaticall aſſembly:</p>
                  <p>While he maintayned that private men might preach and expound the Scriptures at ſet times and places, where the members of ſundry families met together, and this without allowance of the Church:</p>
                  <p>Whiles he maintayned that Churches combined together in the Claſſis, might chooſe a Miniſter, either without or againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Claſſis, under which they ſtood.</p>
                  <p>So to practiſe in theſe Reformed Churches, is no other then a plaine act of ſchiſme, a tending from the Claſſis, and a breaking off from their communion in the government of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Not <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport;</hi> whiles he gathered unto himſelf a great and ſolemne aſſembly apart, by preaching unto them at ſet times in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houſe, without allowance of the Church:</p>
                  <p>Whiles he approoved the Act of our Elders, in admitting him to preach as an aſſiſtant, without the conſent of the Claſſis, in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as is before noted.</p>
                  <p>While he maintayneth the power of every particular Church to be chief in its owne particular matters; and applyeth this to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Miniſters to preach as aſſiſtant, &amp;c. though theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be united in Synod and Claſſis. In all theſe things they did not abhorre ſchiſme as they ought to have done.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whereas they ſpeake ſo much of <hi>eminent perſons</hi> refuſed; who knowes not what imminent danger ariſeth by them, when even they ſometimes are led aſide by their owne ſpirits, and blinded with love of their owne private opinions? <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ainſworth, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iohnſon, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Robinſon</hi> were all eminent men, profeſſing godlines, and for learning not inferiour to <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:1262:44"/>5. It is here to be obſerved, how theſe complaynants as they goe along with their particular accuſations of evill and tyrannicall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſtill they make <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> the burden of their ſong. They accuſe me that I deprive the Church of that liberty and power that Chriſt hath given it in the free choyſe of their Paſtour; This they proove, becauſe <hi>Mr. Davenport</hi> with others were rejected and oppoſed, &amp;c. They accuſe me of depriving the Elders of their power in government: This they would make to appeare by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that an order of the Elders for the ſatisfaction of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> by examination of parents was oppoſed and proteſted againſt by me; and becauſe I conſented not <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> might have a yeares time to goe on in aſſiſting me to preach, &amp;c. They accuſe me of ſubjecting the Church to the Claſſis, by giving them power to keepe out any Miniſters, and they proove it by the inſtances of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo in other points afterward. They accuſes me of bitternes in doctrine, and they would proove it by inſtances of provoking
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> thereby. In the maine circle and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of their diſputation, <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> is the center, and all the chiefe lines of their complaint are drawne from this center. The inordinate deſire of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

                  <p n="6">6. As for that their parentheſis, wherein they note that <hi>I would have had other that to this day hold the ſame opinion:</hi> This <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

                     </note>Secondly, to take the anſwer of <hi>Mr. Balmford,</hi> even as he himſelf hath now of late ſet it downe, under his owne hand; yet can it not thence be juſtly concluded, that it was the ſame anſwer, which
<hi>Mr. Davenport</hi> gave. <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Balmford</hi> ſayth, that he being aſked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would baptiſe thoſe which were preſented to Baptiſme, though not children of any member of our Congregation, his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was to this effect, viz. that <hi>the caſe might be that I ſhould, and the caſe might be that I ſhould not:</hi> And more then to this effect (he ſayth) he anſwered not. Now this is not the ſame with
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> his anſwer, and that in divers reſpects, which I could ſhew: but this may ſuffice for the preſent, that even in the writing of the 5 Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, confirmed by the Claſſis, and impugned by
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> there is a liberty reſerved in ſome caſes that may fall out, that the Miniſter doubting whether the infant preſented ought to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, may then firſt require the judgment of the whole Conſiſtory, or if need be of the Claſſis, and ſo obtaine further reſolution thereby. But this would not ſatisfy <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> which yet might have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Balmford,</hi> notwithſtanding any thing that appeares in his anſwer to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Balmford</hi> was not of the ſame opinion with <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> and therefore could not give the ſame anſwer with him, may appeare by that forme of calling, which was ſent in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

1632.</note> when he was called unto this place. For being called <hi>to miniſter the word and the dependances thereof, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order of theſe Reformed Churches, and eſpecially of theſe which are combined with the Claſſis of Amsterdam;</hi> and making no exception againſt this forme, but reſting therein after that this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion had bene propounded unto him, this is taken for an evidence that he was willing to obſerve their order in the adminiſtration of Baptiſme to ſuch as they uſe to doe, and ſo it was underſtood by the Claſſis. And had <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> accepted this call, when it was in the ſame forme offered unto him, that would alſo have bene taken for a grant of his profeſſed agreement with us, otherwiſe then we now finde.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:1262:45"/>Fourthly, if it be demanded why I did not more particularly and ſtrictly inquire into the opinion of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Balmford,</hi> as well as of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport;</hi> my anſwer is, becauſe I found not ſuch ambiguity in the anſwer of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Balmford</hi> unto the other queſtions, which I had propounded unto him, as I did in the anſwers of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> eſpecially concerning the authority of Synods and Claſſis, about which he made ſome difficulty, and was hardly drawne to conſent: And though at length I conceaved that he agreed with us, yet it ſeemes that he did in ſome manner hide his meaning, as appeareth by that which he hath writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſince unto the Claſſis, touching the power of particular Churches, as being chiefe in their owne particular mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, conſidering the eſtate of that Engliſh Church, whereof <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Balmford</hi> is Miniſter, and what the practiſe thereof hath bene in the admiſſion of members, and receaving them unto the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as hath bene formerly ſignifyed unto me, I thought there was no reaſon for me, to be more earneſt in enquiring of this matter; wherein I judged him not to uſe more ſtrictnes then was obſerved by us.</p>
                  <p>The other inſtance to proove that I deſired him not,
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> ſets downe in theſe words, <hi>And ſince he hath nominated</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Roe <hi>of Fluſhing: though he in anſwer unto a letter, which</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget <hi>ſent unto him concerning this matter, profeſſed himſelfe to be of my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Hereunto I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If I had given my voyce for the calling of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Roe,</hi> being of the ſame judgment with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Davenport,</hi> yet would not this proove that for which <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> alledgeth it, viz. that I never deſired him. It might proove that I deſired <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Roe</hi> more then him, and that I would have borne with the difference of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Roe</hi> more then of him, &amp;c. But this cannot proove that I did never deſire him, or not at all deſire him; ſeeing there are divers degrees of deſire; and for the deſire of ſome friends, a man can tolerate more, then for others whom he yet truely deſireth and affecteth, though not in the ſame meaſure.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The truth is; that nomination which I made of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Roe,</hi> was not a giving of my voyce for his calling, but onely a mentioning of his name among many other Miniſters in theſe Countries, that were taken into conſideration, and that to this end, that there might be
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1262:46"/> made a further enquiry touching their gifts, and touching their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with us, by ſending for them, that we might heare them, and confer with them, as we have done with divers others, with whom yet we never proceeded ſo far as to come unto the election of them. This nomination of
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Roe</hi> was not ſuch an act of election as when I gave my voyce and conſent for the calling of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport.</hi> And therefore thinges are here notably miſmatched together by <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport,</hi> which might deceave an ignorant reader.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whatſoever profeſſion <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Roe</hi> did make of agreeing with the judgment of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> yet was it not ſtrange or unreaſonable for me to hope, that upon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference with him, he might be brought to leave that his opinion. Why might I not mention his name to this end that he might be ſent for, that ſo I might have had opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſee whether I could have ſatisfyed his objections, and taken away his ſcruples? Seeing ſo great paines was taken with <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport</hi> for his perſwaſion, not onely by ſuch as were deputed of the Claſſis, but by ſundry others upon occaſion, why might not ſome part of the like love have bene ſhewed to <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Roe</hi> alſo? What an unworthy thing is it, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Davenport</hi> ſhould make ſuch a diſpute about himſelf, touching my deſire of him, and ſpread theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints among our people in ſuch an unwarrantable manner as he hath done?</p>

                  <p>THeir ſecond inſtance to ſhew how I ſubject the Church unto the undue power of the Claſſis, is becauſe I give them power to make lawes and orders, &amp;c. I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is untrue that I give them this power.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If I had firſt given them counſaile to uſe this power, how doe they proove that this power of making ſuch orders is an undue power? or how can they proove their principall accuſation from hence, that I doe not behave my ſelfe as a Paſtour in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe complaynants themſelves doe allow the Conſiſtory to make orders &amp; lawes; they complaine of me, that I proteſted againſt making of an order for accommodation of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                     <hi>Davenport,</hi> by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the parents unto him, &amp;c. Can this power of making lawes &amp; orders be lawfull and due in a Conſiſtory, and yet an undue power in the Claſſis? Are they not condemned of themſelves?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When they ſay, I <hi>give them power to make lawes;</hi> they doe in ſome meaſure free me from uſurpation, in that I doe not arrogate &amp; take this power to my ſelf, but give it unto others. Could they have ſayd that I uſurpe the power of making lawes, their accuſation had bene heavyer.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is falſe, which they ſpeake of ſubmitting to obſerve all the orders and cuſtomes of the Dutch Church; for neither doe I give, neither doe they take or exerciſe ſuch power, that whoſoever will be Miniſter of this Church, muſt ſubmit himſelfe to all the orders and cuſtomes of the Dutch Church; ſome of them being of leſſer importance, about thinges indifferent and ſuch as might be omitted without offence, for which they would not exclude a Miniſter.</p>
                  <p>To that which they ſay of the Dutch Miniſters, <hi>willing to cast off ſome of their cuſtomes, if the vaſtues of their Church (being but one in ſo great a City) did not force them thereunto, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For thinges that are ſimply unlawfull, there is the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <pb n="80" facs="tcp:1262:47"/> of them in a great Church as in a ſmall, and they are to be caſt off as well in the one as in the other. To deny baptiſme unto ſuch infants as it belongs unto, is ſimply a ſin: To determine that ſuch or ſuch infants are under the covenant, or not under the covenant, is a matter of great weight; and to give wrong ſentence therein, either way muſt needs be a great ſinne: neither have I heard of any one Miniſter among them all, that would deny Baptiſme on ſuch a ground as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Davenport</hi> doth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though the Dutch Church in this City be great, yet the Dutch Churches that are in the villages round about, being members of the ſame Claſſis with us, are generally or for the moſt part far leſſe then this of ours; and yet even there alſo in thoſe ſmaller Congregations the ſame order is obſerved for baptiſing of thoſe infants, whoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are no members of the Church. And therefore their exception in this regard is vayne.</p>
                  <p>Whereas they tell of one Miniſter that ſhould ſpeake of my not conforming to all their orders, and collect thence that they are not willing to tye us ſo ſtrictly to all their orders &amp;c. I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is needfull to be knowne who hath acquainted theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playnants with the ſpeeches and voyces of particular men, contrary to the lawes of the Claſſis. If I ſhould in like diſordred manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and make knowne the particular ſpeeches of ſeverall men, againſt the opinion of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Davenport,</hi> what contention and trouble might ariſe thereupon?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The minde of the Claſſis and their willingnes to tye us unto their order, is not to be collected by the ſpeech of one, but by the generall ſentence and concluſion of the Claſſis. Any wiſe man may ſee what wrong collections theſe men doe make.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſpeech of this Miniſter is not in right manner repeated by them: for neither were his words directed unto me in the ſecond perſon, neither were they uttered with ſuch an interrogative
<hi>why,</hi> by way of expoſtulation, to urge me to anſwer him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This one Miniſter, even he yea more then many other, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelfe to be far from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Davenport</hi> his judgement and practiſe; by his undertaking in writing to ſatisfy M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Davenport</hi> his objections, and ſcruples; who alſo after he had receyved an anſwer from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Davenport,</hi> replyed and wrote againe the ſecond time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which writing he receaved no anſwer from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Davenport.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:1262:47"/>5. For my not obſerving every ſeverall cuſtome of the Dutch Church, beſide the ſpeciall allowance of the Claſſis, which I have had in ſome of them,<note place="margin">Kercken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordeningh Art. <hi>85.</hi>
                     </note> I may alſo alledge for my ſelfe the reſolution of the Nationall Synod at Dort, which in things indifferent doth allow the Churches of other natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in theſe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries to vary fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their cuſtomes.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore whereas they tell againe of an order, which (as they heare) I required our Elders of late to make in the Conſiſtory about conformity to a writing of 5 Miniſters, &amp;c. I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It would here alſo be demanded of theſe complaynants, who hath bene the tale-bearer of whom they have heard ſuch thinges out of the Conſiſtory concerning me. For by this and ſundry the like inſtances, it may appeare from whoſe ſuggeſtion and information this ſlanderous writing hath bene made.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I neither did, and what need had I to ſeeke the confirmation of that writing by a new order in our Conſiſtory, which was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy approoved and confirmed by the Claſſis? Upon occaſion of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſpeech, I ſhewed it to be unreaſonable, if the obſervation of that order, conteyned in that writing, ſhould not be required of any other Miniſter, as well as of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Davenport.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is an odious and ſuſpicious maner of relation, when they ſay, <hi>I got the 5 Miniſters to make that writing in mine owne houſe;</hi> when as by the motion of a Dutch Miniſter, &amp; a ſpeciall friend of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport,</hi> that was the meſſenger, and by the requeſt of ſome of our Elders, as hath bene ſhewed before, they came unto me, and with proteſtation of their deſire to accommodate M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Davenport,</hi> and to further his calling, they made that writing, and therefore came unto my houſe, becauſe being weake and ſickly, I could not ſo well goe out of my houſe to meet them elſwhere.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Here alſo there is fit place to ſhew the untruth of that report, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Davenport</hi> in his<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 4.</note> writing to the Claſſis ſets downe tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching theſe 5 Miniſters, viz. that <hi>upon</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Pagers request alone they did in writing declare their private judgment, &amp;c.</hi> for being come unto me in ſuch maner as is before noted, they reſolved of that courſe of writing their adviſe, not upon my motion or requeſt, but upon the motion of one of thoſe Miniſters, which was approoved by the reſt. But if I had bene the onely ſeeker thereof, what cauſe is there for them that meane to deale vprightly to complaine of ſuch a ſafe and lawfull courſe?</p>

                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:1262:48"/>5. It is alſo a raſh and preſumptuous judgment, when they ſay of that writing, they thinke that no godly man will be abſolutely bound unto it, as though they had power to canonize ſaints &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, and to put out of that canon all theſe Miniſters of the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis that confirmed it, with all ſuch as are not of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Davenport</hi> his minde in refuſing to be bound unto it.

               <p>THirdly, he violently without conſent of any of the Conſistory, bringeth matters thence to the Claſſis, when he cannot have his will unjustly ſatisfyed; and ſo destroyes the power of the Church ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, often affirming they can doe nothing in theſe caſes without the Claſſis; of whom we reverently esteeme for counſell and adviſe in all difficult matters, that cannot be ended amongst our Conſiſtory.</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. IT is no act of violence, as they call it, but a juſt defence and refuge againſt violence, to refer thoſe thinges to the Claſſis, which men conceave to be unjuſtly done, or unjuſtly delayed in the Conſiſtory: in ſuch caſes I have done and ſtill purpoſe to bring mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters unto the Claſſis. Whereas they ſay, that ſo I deſtroy the power of the Church utterly, this is utterly falſe and a notorious ſlander, proceeding either from groſſe ignorance, or els from ſome worſe root of bitternes, and they can never juſtify the ſame. They have made themſelves plaintiffes and accuſers, and from ſuch is exſpected their proofe, which the defendant is then to anſwer, when it once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth. Where is the warrant of <hi>W. Best, N. Ia. Ia. Cr. Io. Pol.?</hi> &amp;c. where is the evidence of <hi>Ioſ. St. La. Co. Aug. Horſ. Tho. Fl.</hi> or any of the reſt? How proove they that I doe utterly deſtroy the power of the Church hereby, why are they not aſhamed to bring their bare word?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Marke here the folly of theſe complaynants; they pretend to ſtand for the liberty of the Church, and yet ſeeke to bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into bondage. If men ſhould ſtay from bringing their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints unto the Claſſis, untill their oppoſites, whether Elders or any others did conſent thereunto, what a miſerable ſervitude would this
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1262:48"/> be? In the title of their complaint, they call themſelves the <hi>burthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and oppreſſed members of the Engliſh Church,</hi> but they might then indeed call themſelves burthened and groane under their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, if the leaſt member in the Church being unſatisfyed in the Conſiſtory, might not have liberty to bring their complaints to the Claſſis, to try where the wilfulnes or the fault is. In the Browniſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call title of the printed booke, there is proclaymed <hi>the miſerable ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and bondage of the Engliſh Church, by reaſon of the tyrannicall government and corrupt doctrine of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iohn Paget,</hi> but if I ſhould in doctrine oppugne, and in practiſe deny unto the members of this Church, this liberty of appeale unto the Claſſis, as they doe here condemne it in me, then might they juſtly complayne of tyrannicall government and corrupt doctrine, then had they cauſe to bewayle their ſlavery and bondage. So unwiſely doe they goe about to pluck upon their heads that which they would ſeeme to put away.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are here againe to be called upon to ſhew what their meaning is, and what they would have men to doe, when they thinke the Elders to be in errour, and to judge unjuſtly in any matter. Shall men ſit ſtill and looke for no redreſſe? Or ſhall men bring the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the body of the Congregation to be debated and diſcuſſed openly before the whole multitude of the Church, according to the practiſe of the Browniſts? Or what other courſe doe they require? let them deale plainly, and tell us what they would have.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The matter of this accuſation about deſtroying the power of the Church, and taking away the liberty thereof, for bringing mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Claſſis without conſent of the Elders, is very like and of the ſame nature with that act and law of the Elders, and made hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon occaſion of the controverſy about <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hooker:</hi> Now ſeeing that act of the Elders is diſannulled by the Claſſis, and made of no force; ſeeing the Claſſis together, with the Deputies of the Synod, have judged and decreed that this unlawfull Act ſhould be raſed out of the Church-booke; and ſeeing this ſentence of the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis hath bene made knowne unto divers of theſe complaynants, as <hi>Th. Fa. Th. Fl. Tho. Ad.</hi> and others,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Novem.</hi> 10. 1631.</note> who came unto the Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to inquire what the Claſſis had reſolved, to whom it was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, that ſome <hi>were deputed from the Claſſis to come unto the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory to diſanull that act; and to ſee it cancelled,</hi> this might have bene a warning unto them, not to have ſet their hands againe unto a new <pb n="84" facs="tcp:1262:49"/> writing in oppoſition unto the Claſſis. For though they ſhewed themſelves diſcontented at that time, and not willing to reſt in the reſolution of the Claſſis, yet time and better advice might have taught them more wiſedom ſince, both for themſelves and their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, whom they ought to have diſſwaded from ſuch a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious enterpriſe as is taken in hand by them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Whereas they ſay they doe <hi>reverently esteeme of the Claſſis for counſell and adviſe in all difficult matters, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe words of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement may deceave a ſimple reader, and happily ſome of the ſubſcribers themſelves that doe not well underſtand one anothers tenet. For what is this their reverent eſteeme? it is but a lame, hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and half reverence, namely for their counſell and adviſe, but not for their authority to judge of controverſies, and decide them; as they doe further manifeſt in their next inſtance. Yea had they but duely eſteemed of the counſell of the Claſſis, though they would not have ſubmitted unto it as a ſentence, yet the reverence and reſpect of it as an wholeſome adviſe, might have bene a meanes to reſtrayne them from the offenſive courſes that have bene taken by them. The truth is, that this pretended reverence is no more then that which <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Iacob</hi> &amp; his company did give to Claſſes and Synods, for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile and adviſe.<note place="margin">Confeſſ. Art. <hi>38.</hi>
                     </note> Yea the Browniſts themſelves doe ſeeme to give as much, when they confeſſe that
<hi>particular Churches are by all meanes convenient to have the help of one another in all needfull affaires of the Church, as members of one body in the common fayth, under Chriſt their onely head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Whereas <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> himſelf takes up a like complaint, that I would not hearken to <hi>his adviſe</hi> for accommodation <hi>without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Claſſis;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Book of complaints pag. <hi>3.</hi> &amp; <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> beſides that which I have anſwered before, let wiſe men judge whether his adviſe was to be preferd, or was ſo ſafe for me to follow as the adviſe of ſo many godly and judicious men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting together in the Claſſis, having alſo a calling to judge of ſuch matters.<note place="margin">Book of complaints pag. <hi>15.</hi>
                     </note> He ſayth, that
<hi>he told me the bringing of it to the Claſsis would make matters worſe;</hi> but ſeeing ſuch aſſemblies of Miniſters are therefore called together to make matters better, and to reforme the worſe, what reaſon hath he of ſuch a ſpeech, unleſſe he knew of ſome, that meant to deale the worſe, when good counſaile ſhould be given unto them? Though he ſay further, that ſome of <hi>the Dutch Miniſters did approove of what he ſayd unto me, and that matters <pb n="85" facs="tcp:1262:49"/> would be worſe els:</hi> I cannot beleeve that they did ſimply and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſpeake as he writes, becauſe I know ſome of them have ſayd otherwiſe unto me, and had he named the Miniſters, I ſhould have knowne how to have given him further anſwer. It may be ſome have wiſhed that the matter might have bene ended privately, or in the Conſiſtory, viz. by his according and agreeing with us, and that otherwiſe it would be worſe for him, and harder for them to allow of his calling. If it was (as he ſayth)
<hi>unlikely that the Claſſis would make an order in favour of him, to condemne their owne cuſtomes;</hi> then was it alſo unlikely that the Dutch Miniſters, members of the Claſſis, would counſaile or allow any ſuch order to be made by our Conſiſtory for the condemning of them; then was it unlikely, unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and not to have bene exſpected of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

               <div type="answer">
                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>FIrſt, it is untrue which they doe here againe repeat, that I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Church under the power of the Claſſis, eſpecially ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of an undue power as they doe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This accuſation (being the ſame in effect with ſome of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, for whatſoever ſhew of method is made herein, yet are the parts of their diviſions divers times confounded) is not ſo much or not more againſt me, then againſt all the Miniſters of theſe Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, and the diſcipline that is exerciſed by them. If the ſubjection of this Church unto the Claſſis, will proove that I doe not behave my ſelf as becommeth a Paſtour in the government of the Church, for which end it is alledged of theſe accuſers; then may eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of theſe Miniſters, in this regard, be in like manner accuſed of not behaving themſelves as becommeth Paſtours, ſeeing the Churches whereof they are Paſtours, are as much ſubjected under <pb n="86" facs="tcp:1262:50"/> the power of the Claſſis, as is this of ours. And if this power of the Claſſis were taken away by them, then ſhould a principall part of their Church-government be taken away, and their diſcipline over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne: And not onely here, but in the Churches of Scotland, France, Geneva, &amp;c. where the like power and authority of Claſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Aſſemblies, as the ſpeciall bond of union, and ſinew of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath bene eſtabliſhed and practiſed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is another injury, when they ſay I ſubject the Church under the authority of the Claſſis, <hi>under pretence of aſking and taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe of the Claſſis:</hi> for that which men doe under a pretence, that they ſeeke to doe covertly, and not to be ſeene therein. Men uſe to hide themſelves and their meanings under the vayle of pretences; but as for me, I have alwayes and doe ſtill openly profeſſe, the authority &amp; power of Synods and Claſſis, to be lawfull and neceſſary, as well as their counſaile and adviſe: I doe in like manner pretend the one as well as the other, and not one under the other.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whereas they ſpeake of our ſubjection to this power of the Claſſis, that <hi>the Church never acknowledged any ſuch power to be due, &amp;c.</hi> this is a plaine falſhood. The Engliſh that firſt made ſuite; the Dutch Miniſters that furthered the ſuit; the Magiſtrates that granted the ſuit, did all agree in this, to have ſuch an Engliſh Church as ſhould accord with the Dutch, in the ſame order of diſcipline &amp; government, and be as the Dutch.</p>
                  <p>Since my firſt comming, which was at the firſt erecting of this Church, I was admitted to be a member of their Claſſis, with ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubſcription and promiſe of union with them. Both I and the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ever ſince as they were deputed thereunto by the Conſiſtory, have from time to time, even unto this preſent, appeared in the Claſſis, in the ſame maner that others did, and both by ſubmiſſion unto their reſolutions, and by actuall exerciſe of the ſame liberty and power, in giving our voyces equally with them, have ſo acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the authority of Claſſicall aſſemblies to be lawfull and juſt.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that are receaved for members of this Congregation, and are newly added to the Church from one communion to another, doe not onely make profeſſion of the ſame fayth with us, but doe alſo by ſolemne promiſe, covenant to ſubmit unto the diſcipline of this Church, according to the rule of Chriſt. And being admitted, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have upon occaſion reſorted unto the Claſſis, and have ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <pb n="87" facs="tcp:1262:50"/> unto their authority, for the judgement of ſuch cauſes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, about which there hath bene queſtion among us.</p>
                  <p>The many Browniſts that have come unto us, leaving their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, were never receaved nor admitted to come with any proteſt againſt this power of the Claſſis, and ſubjection thereunto. <hi>Th. Fa.</hi> of old, when he was receaved of the Dutch Church and ſince of us, and <hi>Th. Ad.</hi> with <hi>St. Of. Ed. Ph.</hi> and <hi>Ed. Sc.</hi> of later times, which now with other ſubſcribers doe complaine of the undue power of the Claſſis, had as much reaſon to have proteſted againſt this power at their firſt admiſſion to the Church. For howſoever the acts and ſentences proceeding from this power, have bene multiplyed on ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry occaſions; yet the power it ſelfe, and the authority of the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, was the ſame at firſt, and no other then it is now.</p>
                  <p>Among many other evidences, there is one pregnant teſtimony hereof, upon occaſion of an Engliſh Synod, which <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Forbes</hi> in ſpeciall laboured to have erected in theſe Countries: For when he urged us many wayes to have joyned with them, we for many weighty reaſons being unwilling thereunto, did in the name of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, Elders and Deacons, with the liking alſo of ſundry of our people acquainted with this buſines, declare and teſtify, both unto Magiſtrates and the Synod, that as we had no will, ſo we had no power to withdraw or disjoyne our ſelves from the Claſſis, with which we were combined as members of the ſame, without their conſent: and by this teſtification their power was then acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of us.</p>
                  <p>To omit other thinges in ſo plaine a caſe, conſider we but one teſtimony of one of theſe my accuſers, who though (forgetting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) he hath ſubſcribed unto this proteſt againſt the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Claſſis, yet hath he of late given great approbation thereof. <hi>Sto. Ofw.</hi> in his booke againſt the Browniſts, having ſayd that <hi>it is far from the true Church to admit of diſorders,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heady &amp; raſh Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures p.

                     </note> though that be not alwayes true, ſeeing many true Churches are oft defiled with much diſorder, and may not therefore be accounted falſe Churches, yet that which followes is both true, and directly againſt this accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, which himſelfe &amp; others have made. Speaking of an holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der obſerved at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and in particular how every Church is to uſe the cenſures appointed by Chriſt, he telles how they have their meetings of Miniſters and Elders, ſome leſſe and ſome greater, ſome <pb facs="tcp:1262:51"/> monethly, ſome yearely, even juſt according to the order of Claſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Synodicall meetings in theſe Countries; and this alſo as he ſayth, for <hi>to give definitive ſentence,</hi> and for <hi>deciding of matters.</hi> Now theſe thinges being actes of power and authority, and more then counſaile and adviſe, and they commended of him for it, who would thinke he ſhould be ſo caryed away with the whirlewinde, as to ſubſcribe to the contrary with theſe complaynants, and to reproch me for ſubjecting this Church to ſuch a power, which had bene ſo lately commended of himſelf?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Their inſolency in accuſing is ſo much the greater, in that they doe ſtill leave their proofes behinde them. They ſay touching the power of the Claſſicall aſſemblies, that it is <hi>ſuch as the Scriptures doe not in any place give to ſuch a company of Ministers:</hi> but they doe not alledge any one place of Scripture to condemne the ſame. Though I for my part have in my ſermons divers times alledged ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry evidences and grounds of holy Scripture, for proofe and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ſuch authority as is exerciſed by Synods and Claſſis; yet now being ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>hemently and hainouſly accuſed by theſe complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, I waite for their arguments and proofes, which hitherto have not appeared. They are falſe accuſers untill they have juſtifyed their charge. It is enough for the defendant or party accuſed, then to give anſwer when arguments are brought againſt him.</p>
                  <p>But theſe complaynants might yet have ſeene themſelves contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by their forenamed fellow-complaynant <hi>St. Ofw.</hi> who brings a remarkable place of Scripture to warrant the exerciſe of that power,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 15.</note> which here they deny. He alledgeth that <hi>when a controverſy aroſe at Antioch, they ſent to Ieruſalem for to bring the Church there unto unity and order, which the Apoſtles performed;</hi> Then he addeth immediately, <hi>and the like doe the Reformed Churches here and in France, and at Geneva.</hi> Now if the Churches here doe practiſe and exerciſe a power, ſo as was done at Antioch and Ieruſalem, and by Apoſtolicall direction, then is not their power an undue power, nor the Churches unjuſtly ſubjected thereunto. This one allegation is ſufficient to evince the falſhood of their aſſertion.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is alſo falſe and abſurd, which they ſay touching the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Claſſis, that it is ſuch <hi>as doth not become any, except the Apostles, that could not erre, to have:</hi> But it is the leſſe marvell that theſe men doe ſpeak on this maner, when as they ſee <hi>Mr. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport</hi> 
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:1262:51"/> himſelfe going before them, and uſing a much like ſpeech in his letter to the Claſſis, touching his conſent required to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the 5 Miniſters, namely,<note place="margin">Book of complaints and pag. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> that
<hi>ſuch a ſubjection is greater then may be yeelded unto any Councell, whether of Claſſis or Synods, &amp;c.</hi> that <hi>thereby the writings and decrees of men are made infallible, and equall with the Word of God, which is intolerable.</hi> But what wiſe man is there that ſees not the ſtrange folly and vanity of ſuch aſſertions as theſe? Is no truth uttered or deſcribed by men in our times, whereunto the conſent of men may be required, becauſe there be now no Apoſtles? Doe not all Reformed Churches at this day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a ſubſcription unto their confeſſions of fayth in the ſeverall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles thereof? Doe they hereby make their writings of equall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with the Word of God, and themſelves equall to the Apoſtles that could not erre? It is far from them. Neither <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> nor theſe complaynants, ſhall ever be able to juſtify theſe ſlanderous complaints. Nay if this were true, how could <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe his name unto his owne writing ſent unto the Claſſis, to ſhew his conſent unto it? Did he thereby make himſelf an Apoſtle or his writing equall with the Word of God? Why may we not ſhew our conſent, and ſubſcribe to other writings of men, upon perſwaſion of the truth ſo appearing unto us, as well as he ſubſcribed to his owne?</p>
                  <p>They are ſo far from prooving theſe aſſertions, that they offer not to goe about it; we acknowledge there is no judicatory on earth, either civill or Eccleſiaſticall, either of Conſiſtory, Claſſis, or Synod, but they are ſubject to errour: when that errour is ſhewed by the Word of God, it ought to be corrected. This alſo is their practiſe, one Synod often reforming that which hath bene decreed by another. Yet doth not this take away their authority for the judgment and deciding of controverſies. For by ſuch reaſoning they might take away all government, and bring in confuſion.</p>
                  <p>By theſe and ſuch-like injurious ſpeeches, they doe exceedingly gratify many ſorts of Libertines, Arrians, Socinians and other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, which doe therefore ſo much abhorre the ſubſcriptions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Churches of God, becauſe they ſerve for detection and diſcovery of their errours. But as the preaching of the Word is not therefore to be condemned, becauſe ſome preach errour; ſo are not ſubſcriptions and that conſent, which is required to many truthes, <pb n="90" facs="tcp:1262:52"/> therefore to be rejected, though ſome doe unjuſtly urge ſubſcription unto errours.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Obſerve here alſo the inexcuſable partiality of theſe complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, who accuſe me for ſubjecting the Church under the authority of the Claſſis, and yet frame no ſuch complaint againſt the Elders of this Church, which (whatſoever ſome of their opinions have bene or are) yet have they all of them by their practiſe acknowledged the authority and power of the Claſſis, where they have ſit with others, and have exerciſed as much authority as any member of the Claſſis, by giving their voyces for deciding, judging and determining of any controverſy, or cauſe that was brought unto them, as well as the reſt. Hereby men may learne the better what to judge of this their writing.</p>
                  <p>Having heard their complaints in reſpect of the whole Churches power and liberty, the Elders power in government, and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Claſſis, let us now heare what their complaint is in reſpect of the particular members thereof.</p>

               <p>FOurthly, he doth not the duety of a Pastour to the particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Congregation, which we proove after this maner.</p>
               <p>First, when godly perſons make their complaints of thoſe that walke diſorderly, and that the cenſures are not executed upon offenders, they that ſeeke the good of the Church, are checked and diſcouraged by him.</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THis accuſation is falſe and ſlanderous. My deſire and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from my firſt calling unto this place, hath bene and is, that the vigour of diſcipline may be mainteyned in our Church; and according to my power, I have laboured that the cenſures might be executed in due maner, for diſcouragement, not of the godly, but of the ungodly and offendours; and as well againſt the richer as the poorer ſort, without acception of perſons. When care and zeale is ſhewed in the adminiſtration of diſcipline, commonly the perſons reprooved and cenſured are diſpleaſed and diſcontented: they and their friends doe oft murmure and complaine, and by themſelves &amp; by their inſtruments great troubles are rayſed up in the Church. And it comes to paſſe ſometimes that the Miniſters of Chriſt are never <pb n="91" facs="tcp:1262:52"/> more reproached for unrighteous dealing, then when they have done moſt righteouſly and zealouſly in the cenſure of offendours.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This accuſation is partiall. For ſeeing the rebukes and cenſures of offendours are not concluded nor executed, but by the moſt voyces and conſent at leaſt of the greateſt part of the Elderſhip: if wrong and injuſtice have bene committed, then if not all, yet the greateſt part muſt be guilty. And what partiality is this, to frame an accuſation againſt me alone, and to complaine of me alone, and to require of me that I alone ſhould anſwer for that, which others have done with me? This ſhewes with what conſcience they have procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this worke.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This accuſation is contradictory to that teſtimony, which the chiefe of theſe complaynants themſelves have given of me in their proteſtation unto the Claſſis, with ſo great commendation both of my <hi>life and doctrine,</hi> and in ſuch a meaſure that they deſired <hi>no better Pastour,</hi> and this in the name of Elders, Deacons, and other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, upon occaſion of the controverſy concerning <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hooker.</hi> Hereby they make themſelves guilty and treſpaſſers againſt the truth. If then they ſpake <hi>without flattery,</hi> as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed; how can they now ſpeake without ſlander, touching my inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in this kinde, without ſome new evidence thereof.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This accuſation is moſt diſordered, for if ſuch evills have bene committed by me in the Elderſhip, why did not theſe accuſers ſeeke redreſſe at the ſame time? Or if they could get no redreſſe in the Elderſhip, why did they not complaine to the Claſſis? Or if they would not ſubject the affaires of the Church unto the undue power of the Claſſis, as they call it, why did they not then bethinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of ſome other forme of diſcipline, that might have affoorded them more redreſſe of evills? Or if they had now juſt cauſe to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from the communion, for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Davenport</hi> his cauſe, untill they had teſtifyed againſt evill, why had they not as juſt reaſon then? What good can be exſpected to enſue upon ſuch diſordred and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable courſes?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This accuſation can with leſſe reaſon be made by theſe men, then by many others. For if there have bene a fayling in the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for not cenſuring of offendours (and what governours of the Church, even the godlyeſt, doe not ſometimes faile?) then hath it bene in the not cenſuring of the offences of ſome of theſe complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1262:53"/> For example, <hi>William Baſt,</hi> the foreman of the ſubſcribers, and the publiſher of that ſcandalous pamphlet of complaints againſt me, hath given great offence, and is become an evill example unto many, by the open violation of the Sabbath in his owne houſe, and by his reſorting unto the aſſembly of the Remonſtrants. He hath bene admoniſhed by me, and in the name of the Elderſhip, and hath juſtly deſerved further cenſure. With what face can he complaine that <hi>the cenſures are not executed upon offenders?</hi> Why doth not this complaynant awaken his owne frozen and benummed conſcience, to conſider better of his owne wayes, before he take up ſtones to caſt at others?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tho. Flet.</hi> another of theſe complaynants hath heretofore cauſed great diſturbance in our Church, by the diſordred and offenſive courſes taken by him. For (as hath bene noted before) when he ſought to hinder the calling of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Balmford,</hi> and to diſcourage him from comming unto us, he then went about from houſe to houſe, with a catalogue of names to get and gather the conſent, not onely of men, but of women and maydes alſo, as if they had had power to give voyces in the election of Miniſters, and being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed of this ſcandall by the Elderſhip, he yet refuſed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his fault therein. If we have fayled in cenſuring offenders, ſurely there is much cauſe to remember our remiſſenes towards him.</p>
                  <p>And not he onely, but other of theſe complaynants that were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate in his behalf, have reaſon to conſider their owne guiltines in that which they unjuſtly impute unto me. For notwithſtanding this great diſorder of <hi>Tho. Fl.</hi> which the Elders would have taken into further conſideration, yet <hi>A.H. H.D. Io. Po. Ia. Cr. Io. St. D.B.</hi> and others, comming to the Conſiſtory the evening before the Lords Supper, were urgent to have a preſent end without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delay, though <hi>Th. Fl.</hi> would not acknowledge this his fault, ſignifying that otherwiſe they were not willing for this time to come to the communion. This was ſuch an act of violent dealing, in hindring the juſt cenſure of offenders and diſordred perſons, as I doe not remember the like ſince the Church was firſt erected. They were ſo earneſt in the buſines by threatning a kinde of ſchiſme, that it was thought good by the Elderſhip, together with the Deacons, to give place unto the importunity of theſe brethren, and for that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1262:53"/> time to let paſſe that which was paſt; having firſt ſhewed what their duety was in ſuch caſes, and alwayes reſerving our liberty to witnes the truth, and to deale againſt ſuch errours and diſorders hereafter, as occaſion ſhould be given.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, what is it that more hinders the due adminiſtration of diſcipline, cauſing that the cenſures are not executed upon ſuch as walke diſorderly, then when there is a conſpiracy and combination of many perſons together in ſome evill enterpriſe? It is commonly obſerved among men, that the multitude of offenders procures im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity of offences. If men that walke diſorderly, would deviſe how to breake downe the wall of diſcipline, and free themſelves from cenſure, what readyer courſe could they take, then to band them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in companyes, and ſo to ruſh forward in their wayes, and to diſcourage and weaken the hands of ſuch governours of the Church, as ſhould correct their diſorders? Now this is the very practiſe of theſe complaynants in this their preſent enterpriſe, in this their inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious writing: for here they joyne hand in hand, they ſet name by name, and who ſhall now ſtay them?</p>
                  <p>This conſociation in evill makes them in a high degree guilty of that very thing they complaine of in this article. Hereby they ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and harden one another in ſin. Hereby others are ſeduced and drawne away, to follow their courſe, as is noted in the end of the printed booke. And while they walke ſo diſorderly, how can the cenſures without great difficulty be executed?<note place="margin">

               <p>SEcondly, when ſome have bene ſuspended from the Lords Table, they may live many yeares and dye in their ſins, before he lookes after them to reclaime them.</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THe admonition of ſuſpended perſons is performed either in the Conſiſtory, when they are ſent for thither, or when ſome are deputed out of the Conſiſtory to goe unto them; or when they are upon occaſion ſpoken unto by one alone. And ech of theſe wayes have I many a time and oft admoniſhed ſuch perſons, that they might be reclaimed, and neither live nor dye in their ſins.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:1262:54"/>2. Seeing ſuſpended perſons are ordinarily often admoniſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their ſuſpenſion, the admonition which belongs unto them moſt properly, is in the Elderſhip, after that more private admonition hath bene deſpiſed of them. If this duety have bene neglected in the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip, what partiality is it in theſe accuſers, to complaine of me alone, for that thing which concernes the reſt of the Elders, when as they know not which of us be moſt faulty therein?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is alſo a difference to be put betwixt ſuſpended per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: ſome of them being more tractable and ready to heare; others more obſtinate, and ready to rend thoſe that admoniſh them with reproches and raylings. And the Scripture ſhewes that we are not ſo much bound to admoniſh the one ſort as the other; leaſt the name of God ſhould be taken in vayne, and his holy things deſpiſed as well as we rent.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The order agreed upon in the Conſiſtory, is this, that in caſes of admonition thoſe Elders or Miniſters, in whoſe quarter the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be admoniſhed doe dwell, are ordinarily to be employed therein before others. Neither doe I know that in my quarter any ſuſpended perſons have remayned without admonition by me. And it is unreaſonable to blame me for that, which hath bene neglected in anothers quarter.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If any of theſe complaynants had at any time diſcerned, or thought that there was a defect or neglect of duety, in regard of any one ſuſpended perſon, and that there was ſpeciall need of admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing ſuch an one; had there bene a Chriſtian conſideration of their duety in ſuch caſe, they might have bene led thereby, either to have advertiſed me thereof in private, or to have ſignifyed it unto the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip, and to have required their further care therein, at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had made ſuch a ſcandalous proteſtation to the offence of many.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I have the leſſe incouragement to the performance of this worke, through the fault of ſome of theſe my accuſers, and to give inſtance hereof; A certaine perſon of our Church being ſuſpended for profaning the Lords-day, and being admoniſhed of this ſcandall, hath this anſwer in readines; why doe you not as well ſuſpend ſuch and ſuch perſons, and by name <hi>Will. Best,</hi> for his open Shop upon the Sabbath-day? Thus is this accuſers evill example a ſtumbling block to many, and though the others fault is in a higher degree, and <pb n="95" facs="tcp:1262:54"/> therefore is ſuſpended rather then he, yet even that which is done by him alſo is very offenſive, both for ſtrengthening of others in ſinne, and for weakning of us, that ſhould admoniſh the ſuſpended per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. FOr viſitation of the ſick, it is a duety wherein by the bleſſing of God, I have had much comfort in miniſtring of comfort unto others; and therefore have bene carefull to performe the ſame, according to my power and above my power, both to rich &amp; poore, to Engliſh and Dutch, to the members of the Church, and to them that are no members of the Church, to ſuch as were diſeaſed in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and to ſuch as have bene afflicted in minde. My labour &amp; wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines in going from one ſide of the City to another upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, hath bene ſuch, that thereupon I have evidently and ſenſibly fallen into great ſicknes. And where more danger was, being called thereunto, I have not refuſed to viſit many viſited with the Peſt, to comfort them in the time of their anguiſh: Yea in the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious places, as where in one poore family, the floore hath bene covered with death, ſome perſons being already dead of the plague, and ſome ready to give up the ghoſt, lying ſo thicke on the ground, that I could ſcarſely ſet my foote beſide them, being ſix of them in one ſmall roome, 3 dead, and 3 dying upon their pallets; yet have I with cheerefulnes and comfort gone among them, to exhort them, to pray with them, and to miniſter the conſolations of Chriſt unto them as need required. And though in regard of weaknes, I am not able to doe ſo much as I have done; though my ſtrength be leſſe, yet I purpoſe and hope that my care ſhall be more, and when I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not goe faſter, yet to creepe forth for performance of this duety. Whereas by the favour of the Magiſtrates there are mainteyned in this City certaine <hi>Siecken-trooſters,</hi> or
<hi>Comforters of the ſick,</hi> for aſſiſtance of the Dutch Miniſters, to ſupply their place in viſiting of the ſick, eſpecially when contagious and peſtilentiall diſeaſes doe <pb facs="tcp:1262:55"/> abound, and thereby the Miniſters of the Dutch Church are excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and eaſed of a great part of their burden, labour and danger in viſiting of the ſick; yet have I not ſought any ſuch help for my excuſe in this behalf, but have alone willingly undergone the burden hereof. Had theſe complaynants well conſidered of the matter, they would rather have themſelves become
<hi>Siecken-troasters,</hi> to ſupply what was wanting in me,<note place="margin">

<hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.14.</note> then in ſo ſcandalous maner to have reproched and accuſed me; it being alſo the duety of every particular Chriſtian, to be a viſiter and comforter of the ſick, and eſpecially it might have bene exſpected of ſome of theſe complaynants, that have taken upon them ſo much, even more then they ought in preaching and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Scriptures, when they were not lawfully called thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For viſitation of members before the Lords Supper, though I have duely and ordinarily in former times obſerved it, yet upon the death of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Pot</hi> my fellow-miniſter, and faythfull fellow-labourer in the Lord, the Elders of our Church tooke upon them to free me from that labour, by viſiting the members at ſuch time, untill an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Miniſter might be provided, which was then hoped would be no long time. When I then intermitted that viſitation, it was not that I might live in idlenes, for my labour was double to that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by preaching as many ſermons, as both he and I together did before; and withall viſited ſick perſons upon occaſion as I could. This being continued for 2 yeares after his death, at length through infirmity of body, rheumes, and hoarſenes of voyce, I was forced to leave ſome exerciſes, as that ſermon on Wedneſdayes, and that before the Lords Supper, preaching onely twiſe on the Lords-day. After this I had alſo long ſickneſſes with many troubles, ſo that my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is now very great, and will not permit to indure ſuch travell in viſiting as I have done. Common humanity might have taught my accuſers to have conſidered theſe thinges, and ſo not to have bene ſo immodeſt and unreaſonable in reproching of me.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As for this ſolemne viſitation of members before the Lords-Supper, ſeeing it doth not appeare from the Scriptures, that it was any expreſſe or immediate ordinance of God, yea or that it could be well practiſed in the primitive Church, when as it ſeemes they did celebrate the Lords Supper ſo frequently,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42.</note> and even every Lords-day, they ought for this cauſe alſo to have beene more ſparing in their accuſation. Otherwiſe, where communions are not ſo frequent, <pb n="97" facs="tcp:1262:55"/> I acknowledge that there is proffitable uſe thereof, and my purpoſe alſo is as the Lord ſhall inable me to obſerve the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For that they ſpeake of <hi>divers members never once viſited by me in divers yeares,</hi> that might alſo well be, and yet without any fault of mine. For ſeeing the City where we live, is large and great, and the members of our Church ſcattered here and there throughout the ſame in many ſtreates, lanes and corners thereof, it was therefore by order and agreement among our ſelves devided into divers quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which were to be viſited and attended upon, each knowing his owne quarter, that none might be left unviſited by one or other. And what wonder then, if thoſe members of the Church, which dwelt in an other quarter, were never viſited by me, that had my ſtation and ſpeciall watch-aſſigned unto me in an other place? And thus it is alſo with the Dutch Miniſters in their viſitations of their people, whoſe order we follow herein.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For viſitation of the ſick,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.14.</note> ſeeing it is a duety which the Holy Ghoſt hath in ſpeciall maner layd upon the Elders of the Church; ſeeing my care and diligence in performance of this duety, hath not bene inferiour unto the care of the Elders; ſeeing many members of the Church doe more complaine of the negligence of the Elders in this regard; this ſhewes how partially and unconſcionably theſe complaynants have framed their accuſation in blameing me alone, which yet have had as juſt excuſe as our Elders, of whom they doe not here utter any one word of complaint at all.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is alſo to be remembred touching the viſitation of the ſick, that the Apoſtle exhorts thoſe that are ſick to <hi>call for the Elders</hi> of the Church, that they may pray for them, &amp;c. For being called for,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.14.</note> they may with more comfort undertake the worke. And this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of calling for them, ought at leaſt to prevayle ſo far with men, as to ſtay them from contumelious reproach of the Miniſters, untill they have called or ſent for them. And had this bene thought of by theſe complaynants, it might have ſtayed them from accuſing of me, who (if it were poſſible) never (to my knowledge) refuſed to viſit any that called for me, whether in my quarter or of an other; whether members of the Church or not.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That which ſhould encourage a Miniſter unto the viſitation of the ſick, is the peacable entertainment which he findeth when he comes unto them. There be houſes that are houſes of ſtrife, and ſome
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1262:56"/> ſick perſons that are ſick of ſtrife, when their deſire and will is no ſatisfyed. The viſitation of ſuch doth ſometimes exaſperate the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable paſſion of impatient ſtrife,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.17.</note> and therefore as the Lord war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all men to withdraw their foot from their neighbours houſe, when there is feare and danger, that viſitation may occaſion hatred and indignation,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 10.6.</note> even ſo Miniſters alſo are directed of Chriſt, to have reſpect unto this rule of converſation, by obſerving where the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of peace doe dwell, and diſpoſing their way accordingly. And in ſuch caſes a Miniſter ought to be excuſed, if he viſit not ſo often as otherwiſe he would.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For the viſitation of the members of the Church before the Lords Supper, I have not had ſo much encouragement thereunto of later time as formerly I have had. For ſeeing our maner and order is, that Miniſters and Elders goe together about this worke, and ſeeing ſome of the Elders have declared, both by word and practiſe, that they are of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Davenport</hi> his minde, touching ſome of theſe controverſyes, that have bene ſo offenſive among us; if any of theſe Elders going with me in this viſitation, we ſhould finde ſome mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, which ſignify unto us that they are alſo of <hi>Mr. Davenport</hi> his judgement, and ſay that they are troubled in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience about theſe thinges, and require reſolution of their doubts; what is now to be done? I labour to ſhew him <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> his errour; The Elder with me (if he deale in conſcience according to his profeſſion) labours to maintayne M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Davenport</hi> his opinion, and to reſiſt me in this viſitation. If on the contrary we meet with ſuch of our people, as diſlike the judgment &amp; practiſe of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> and tell how they are offended with ſuch as doe oppugne the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and order of theſe Reformed Churches, and require the Elder to ſhew warrant of his opinion, wherein he takes part with <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport;</hi> If hereupon this Elder begin to pleade for <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

And what trouble then was to be exſpected in this viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, beſides the former kindes of viſitation in time of ſicknes, and before the Lords Supper, there is an other kinde of more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary viſitation of members of the Church, when according to the bond of Chriſtian communion and fellowſhip, thoſe that are neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1262:56"/> and friends doe meet together, eſpecially when the poorer fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, the fatherleſſe and the widowes are viſited in their wants. It is not enough ſometimes to viſit the houſes of the poore, unleſſe the poore be allowed to viſit us, unleſſe by a loving and kinde invitation they be called unto us; if there be not, as the H. Ghoſt ſpeaks,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of the ſoule unto them</hi> in familiar conference and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion together. This duety I have endeavoured according to my power to performe, and that with cheerfulnes &amp; ſinglenes of heart. This courſe of viſitation hath bene duely and conſtantly obſerved by me, neither doe I know that ever any week hath paſſed for more then 20 yeares together, wherein ſome or other, more or leſſe, have not bene thus viſited by me, if not by my going to them or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, yet at leaſt by their comming unto my houſe, if ſicknes or a journey, or ſome other neceſſity did not hinder, and that to this end, that we might rejoyce together in the Lord, and that we might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate together in the gifts of God, for our mutuall comfort, both theirs and mine. I ſhould have abhorred to ſpeak ſo much of my ſelf, but that my importunate accuſers have compelled me by theſe complaints: and in ſuch caſe many men of God have not refuſed to doe the like.</p>

                  <p>FIrſt it is untrue which they ſay concerning the weekly ſermons on Wedneſdayes, that the Elderſhip agreed, that upon my refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall <hi>any other</hi> they could get ſhould doe it. It was agreed by the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip, that <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> ſhould be ſpoken unto for his aſſiſtance therein, but no agreement for <hi>any other.</hi> This is evident from their owne act thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is alſo untrue which they write of the Elderſhips agreement, that any other <hi>they could get</hi> ſhould doe it. In one ſentence they are guilty of double untruth, as before there was an untruth in regard of the perſons to be got, ſo here another untruth in reſpect of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <pb n="100" facs="tcp:1262:57"/> 
                     <hi>by whom</hi> they ſhould be got. For this had bene moſt unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that it ſhould have bene referred unto theſe complaynants to get whom they could. This had bene many wayes againſt good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As for <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> his preaching in that maner, before we were aſſured of his accord with us, it had bene a meane to nouriſh &amp; continue ſtrife in the Congregation; a meanes to delay and hinder the calling of another Miniſter, as I ſhewed before in anſwer to their complaint, which is here idely repeated.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Although <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> had before offered his aſſiſtance in preaching, if the Elderſhip ſhould deſire it, and although the Elders did agree, and conclude for <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> and thereupon deputed ſome to ſpeake unto him about his aſſiſtance in preaching on the weeke dayes, and to intreat him to begin with the preparatory Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on Saturday next following, &amp;c. yet even they themſelves or
<hi>Mr. Davenport,</hi> or both, ſeeing the inconveniences and danger that might enſue thereupon, did not proceede to put their raſh agreement in execution, but (as it ſeemeth) thought it beſt to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, at leaſt untill a better occaſion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Whereas they ſpeake of aſſiſtance offered unto me <hi>without my charge at least,</hi> this was but a vayne offer: for as on the other ſide I needed not to be at any charge for ſuch aſſiſtance, ſo had it bene an unreaſonable thing, if in regard of freedome from coſt and charges, I ſhould have conſented to ſuch a courſe of aſſiſtance, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved to be againſt the peace of our Church.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Suppoſe their offred aſſiſtance had not bene the leaſt charge unto me, yet might it have bene a very great charge unto the Church, if they had payed for it according to the proportion of that collect, that was made for <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

                  <p n="7">7. Whereas they ſay further of theſe weekly ſermons, that I would <hi>neither performe them my ſelfe, nor ſuffer, &amp;c.</hi> they know, or may know well enough, that I did performe thoſe weekly Sermons my ſelfe alone, both divers yeares before the comming of

               <div type="answer">
                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>HAving anſwered their manifold ſlanders, touching my beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the government of the Church, let us now heare what they have to object againſt my doctrine. And here playing the Rhetoricians, they make a ſhew of paſſing by ſome fault, which they doe not reckon in the number of thoſe particulars that follow. They ſeeme I ſay, by a minſing figure of extenuation, to let a fault paſſe, which yet they doe not. They are content to have ſomethings, which are no light matters, nor of ſmall reproach, to be reckoned for ſmall in compariſon, and to let paſſe the proofe of them; that ſo theſe things, which they profeſſe to ſtand upon, may be imagined to be the greater and the more heynous. But here they doe not let paſſe this lighter fault, without a threefold reproach, 1. that my
<hi>Sermons be ſleight;</hi> 2. that theſe ſleight Sermons be
<hi>many.</hi> 3. They aggravate it, that this is done by <hi>a man of my abilities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the ſleightnes of my Sermons, I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This accuſation is ſlanderous, they have not offered to proove it, neither can they doe it. Whatſoever my weaknes is, yet the doctrines, exhortations, conſolations, delivered in my Sermons, being drawne by juſt conſequence from the word of truth, conteyne in them the wiſedome of God, and the power of God unto ſalvation, and therefore not to be ſleighted. Whatſoever infirmities have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in my delivery of this word, they ought from thence to have taken occaſion of glorifying God, who perfecteth his power in mans weaknes,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi>
9.12.</note> and will therefore have the treaſure of his Goſpell to be caryed forth in earthen veſſells, and the excellent pearle of the knowledge of Chriſt, to be kept in<note n="*" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7</note> oyſterſhelles, or veſſels made thereof, as the Greek words import, that the excellency of that power might be of God, and not of the Miniſters. For as there is a huge difference of price betwixt the baſe oyſters, and the coſtly pearles that are found therein; ſo the infinite price and vertue of the Euangelicall pearle is the more to be acknowledged, being found in the miniſtery of frayle humane ſhelles.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. No marvell that I ſhould be ſleighted of them, when the moſt <pb n="102" facs="tcp:1262:58"/> holy Apoſtles,<note place="margin">2.
<hi>Cor.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53.3. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.22. <hi>Ioh.</hi>
10.20.</note> when Paul himſelfe was ſleighted, as a man whoſe <hi>bodily preſence was weake, and his ſpeech contemptible, or of no value;</hi> they complayned of him for his ſleight Sermons. Even Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was ſleighted and rejected of men, made as nothing, eſteemed as a mad man, and not to be heard.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is the leſſe marvell that I ſhould be thus ſleighted by ſome of theſe complaynants, that doe magnify themſelves, and have ſet up themſelves to be preachers in their ordinary meetings, where divers members of ſundry families have met together to heare them, and this without allowance of the Church. It ſeemes the ſermons of <hi>Tho. Flet. Ia. Cr.</hi> and others, have bene ſo excellent, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and other of theſe complaynants, that have bene their hearers, doe ſo eſteeme thereof, that my Sermons, in compariſon of theirs, are but ſleight Sermons. May I not ſay to theſe accuſers, as the Apoſtle once to ſome among the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi>
4.8.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Now ye are full, now ye are rich, &amp;c. we are fooles for Chriſts ſake, but ye are wiſe in Chriſt, we are weake, yee are ſtrong; yee are honourable, but we are despiſed.</hi> Ye are eminent men, and we are ſleight teachers.</p>
                  <p>For the number of my ſleight Sermons, which they will have to be many: I leave it to the judgement of unpartiall hearers of me. And if need be, I am ready to ſubmit the tryall of any of them to the judgement of the learned, having the notes of them all by me. Had theſe complayners given an inſtance but of any one Sermon, and ſhewed wherein the ſleightnes thereof did conſiſt, I might then have given a more full anſwer unto them.</p>
                  <p>For my Abilities, which they odiouſly alledge, to aggravate my fault, as if through ſloathfullnes and idlenes, I had done the worke of the Lord negligently; I anſwer, that Abilities are either of body or minde.</p>
                  <p>For my Ability of body, it is very ſmall, and when I was in the ſtrength of my age, I was but a weake man. But now through age and labour, and much ſicknes, my ſtrength is exceedingly decayed, and my weaknes augmented. Yet in this weaknes I have laboured above my ability and ſtrength of body, both in ſtudy and in ſpeaking with extenſion of voyce, ſo that I have thereupon fallen into further ſicknes, and ſenſibly diſcerned an increaſe of my weaknes. And being much troubled with an infirmity of hoarſenes, the thinges that are ſpoken with a low, weake and hoarſe voyce, ſeeme unto ſome to <pb n="103" facs="tcp:1262:58"/> be weake and ſleight, even to ſuch as regard a ſound of words, more then ſoundnes of matter.</p>
                  <p>And for Ability of minde, it depends in ſome part upon the Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of body:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.12</note> for when the body is not ſo able to endure the labour of ſtudy, of writing and reading, which are a wearines unto the fleſh, then is the minde leſſe furniſhed through want of ſtudy. Againe, heavines in the heart of man bringeth it downe; and ſo the minde is weakned. Now whether many of theſe complaynants have not ſought ſo much as in them lyes, to make me dejected with heavines, let any judge that reads this their writing, and heares of their other behaviour ſutable thereunto. And let themſelves thinke whether they be not guilty of giving occaſion, that I ſhould make the ſleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sermons; conſidering what the Apoſtle teſtifyeth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi>
13.17</note> that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable for the people to make their Miniſters ſorowfull. As for me, my deſire hath bene, and my reſolution is, not to hide my Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in a napkin, but through the grace of God (by which I am that I am) according to my ability, to imploy the ſame to the good of Gods Church, hoping at length with the faythfull ſervants to enter into my Maiſters joy.</p>

Neither doe I know any other reaſonable pretence for ſuch a ſlander.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is another ſlander, when they ſay, I

                     </gap>ke to excuſe their ſpeech, yet can they not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame in ſuch a broad and looſe kinde of expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>This accuſation not onely of my doctrine, but of the very text it ſelfe for my ſake, is not unlike to the accuſation made againſt a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Miniſter in England, lately related unto me by a friend. This Miniſter was complained of in a Biſhops court, concerning the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1262:60"/> doctrine which he had preached, and to aggravate the complaine, it was ſaid, <hi>My Lord, the very text which he choſe is Puritanicall.</hi> But the Biſhop reprooving the complaynant, wiſhed him to abſtaine from accuſing the text it ſelf: and this might ſerve for a juſt rebuke of theſe my accuſers, that doe ſo over-reach in ſtriking at me.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This text of Iſaiah the fifth touching the vineyard, is ſo far from being fit to ſtirre up contention, that on the contrary it is very fit for the repreſſing of contention, and for the reproofe of contentious perſons. This may be obſerved in ſpeciall, both from the bleſſing of the vineyard, to have an hedge, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. and from the deſolation of the vineyard, in taking away the wall and hedge thereof, <hi>verſ. 5.</hi> which is done by contention, which violates the order of the Church, which is the wall thereof. Contention alſo may well be reckoned among the wilde grapes, which the Lord there complaines of, it being comprehended under that oppreſſion, clamor or crying, noted
<hi>verſ.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is ſpeciall comfort unto me to remember, that even as our bleſſed Lord Ieſus, for expounding this very text from Iſaiah the fifth touching the parable of the vineyard, was perſecuted by the Iewes, and then eſpecially even at that houre they ſought to lay hands upon him: Even ſo theſe my accuſers, at the very ſame time of my expounding this parable, and for chooſing this Text, have now here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon done unto me this great wrong, by framing this accuſatory writing againſt me, ſuch as I never met withall before, nor ever (to my remembrance) heard of the like in my time by any that made profeſſion of zeale in Religion.</p>
                  <p>Whereas they doe here againe renew their complaint, and in 3 ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles together doe accuſe me of bitternes in teaching againſt the godly, in the former, in this, and in the Section following, my anſwer is,</p>

Who knowes not that the principall preſervatives of bodily health are the bittereſt receipts, and that in time of peſtilence for avoyding of infection, men doe willingly uſe wormewood, and Rue, Angelica, and like bitter herbes and rootes? And if for health of body men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe not bitter compoſitions, ſuch as <hi>Hiera picra,</hi> or <hi>Holy bitter,</hi> how much more for the eternall ſalvation of the ſoule ought men to receave thoſe rebukes, and reproofes of ſin, which for the preſent are bitter to the fleſh,<note place="margin">

As God ordained that the Paſchall Lambe ſhould be eaten with bitter hearbes; ſo to procure appetite &amp; ſpirituall hunger after Chriſt, and his righteouſnes, and to enjoy the fruit both of the Law and Goſpell, theſe reproofes of ſin, eſteemed ſo bitter, are yet moſt neceſſary.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a great errour in ſome to account that bitter, which others account ſweet: for as unto a corrupt ſtomack, even the moſt wholeſome and pleaſant meates, are unſavoury and bitter; even ſo unto ſome corrupt mindes, even the conſolations of God ſeeme ſtrange and unſavoury.

                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:1262:61"/>It is to be obſerved, that though in ſundry other articles of their complaint, they have alledged (though mis-alledged) particular inſtances: yet in this complaint of bitternes, they have not brought any particular inſtances: though they pretend there be many, yet have they not ſpecifyed one paſſage, either in regard of matter, or harſh phraſe to manifeſt the bitternes of my doctrine. Unto ſuch generall complaints, I can give no other then generall anſwers.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Againſt this unjuſt complaint of theirs, I may juſtly oppoſe the teſtimony of a great number of our Congregation, who can and doe teſtify, that ſuch bitternes hath not bene uſed by me in my doctrine, but that I have rather bene too remiſſe in reproofe of ſuch great diſorders as have of late crept in among us. It is obſerved according to the variety of gifts, that ſome Miniſters doe exceede others in the ſharp rebuke of ſin, and ſome in the miniſtring of conſolation: and I doe not know that I have bene reputed among the firſt ſort. And for my ſelf, I can with good conſcience teſtify, that I am not privy to my ſelf of wronging them with any bitter or hard ſpeeches in any particular paſſages in my Sermons. Have I offended in any part of my miniſtery, I judge it to be in the too much lenity that hath bene uſed by me.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It leaſt of all becommeth theſe men to complaine of bitternes, whiles they themſelves are ſo notoriouſly guilty of bitter contention and ſtrife. As David ſayd once of his enemies,<note place="margin">

This writing ſhewes a roote of bitternes in them, which hath ſprung up and ſpread it ſelfe into ſo many articles of complaint and reproach, to the defiling of many: And though it be true of all men by nature, that they are a generation of ſerpents;<note place="margin">

                  <p>Whereas they ſay, <hi>I make them vile before the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to be inſulted over by unworthy termes from thoſe of my ſide, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer,</p>

If their owne inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate courſes doe not make them vile, and to be diſliked of the whole Congregation, then can my doctrine be no offence unto them, but is far from making them vile. The word of the Lord ſpoken by me is good unto them to walk uprightly, and I am ready to manifeſt the ſame in the particulars thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For ſuch as ſhall inſult over them by unworthy termes, I doe not approove any ſuch inſultations and vaine boaſtings, but judge them worthy to be reprooved.

                  <p n="1">1. THe private meetings, or rather the publick meetings in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houſes, which I preached againſt, were ſuch where pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men doe preach ordinarily at ſet times and places; where divers members of ſundry families doe meet together to heare, and this without allowance of the Church. This is ſuch a diſorder, as even the Browniſts themſelves doe diſlike and would not tolerate among them. If I have offended hereabout, it is that I have not preached oftner againſt the ſame, there being ſuch occaſion given thereunto. If this doctrine be bitter unto them, it ariſeth from the root of bitternes in themſelves, that cannot endure a juſt reproofe of ſuch a diſordred practiſe. Would theſe accuſers make good their accuſation, why have they not brought ſome warrant from the Scripture to juſtify their owne way, or to refute my doctrine? How ſhameles a thing is it, to accuſe me of obſtinacy, and not to convince me by the word of God? to teſtify before all men, that howſoever I beare the name, and fill up the place of a Paſtour, yet I doe not the duety of a Paſtour, neither in government nor in doctrine, and yet not to manifeſt my doctrine to be repugnant to the Scriptures? As for other private conferences and godly exhortations and conſolations, and mutuall dueties of Chriſtians, I have ever exhorted and encouraged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>

<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> was lawfull and unblameable, what reaſon is there either for him, or any of his friends, to be offended at this moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary doctrine thus generally delivered, and in good maner from ſo pregnant a text? But if the practiſe of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> was inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate and unlawfull; there was no reaſon that I ſhould refuſe to ſpeake of ſuch wholeſome doctrine, either for feare or favour, either of
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> or theſe complaynants his friends. And what is this their complaint but to mis-call the manifeſt truth of God, and to make it a manifeſt injury? If the publiſhing of this word ſhall thus be accounted a reproaching; then may I ſay with the Prophet,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ier.</hi>
20.8.</note> 
                     <hi>The word of the Lord was made a reproach unto me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. When they ſay, I reproached him <hi>in my Pulpit,</hi> though there ſeemes to be ſome kinde of ſcorne in this their ſpeech, yet it ſerves to ſhew that what I taught it was in the place whereunto I was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called. And even this ſhewes, that it was the greater inſolency in that perſon, who when as I had in this place in the forenoone taught againſt the preaching of private men, that he in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone of the ſame day, in the ſame place, ſhould oppugne this doctrine they ſpeak of, to the offence of many.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To excuſe the preaching of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> without a calling, they give it the name of <hi>catechiſing a family,</hi> as if it had bene but a family exerciſe. What is this but a mockery to deceave and bleare the eyes of ſuch as might read their writing, when as the members of 30 or 40 families or more have bene reckoned to aſſemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that place? If ſuch a courſe were lawfull, any ſectary under pretence of a family exerciſe, might ſet open his dores and gather a multitude of people unto them. And further to open the grounds of Religion (as they ſpeake) in ſuch a catechiſing as he uſed, may as well be counted preaching as any other. And Catecheticall Sermons made without a calling or due allowance, may proove as dangerous as any other; whether preached at 3 or at 5 a clock; whether before or after other Sermons ended.</p>

                  <p>FIrſt concerning the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which hath bene betweene
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

Davenport</hi> to deny baptiſme unto ſuch; yet is this no reproachfull upbrayding of him, unles theſe complaynants could convince me of errour for ſo ſpeaking. When Mr.
<hi>Davenport</hi> ſignifyed unto me, that he was not of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hookers</hi> opinion in ſundry points; that he was of the ſame opinion with me, this was in effect as much as if he had ſayd in expreſſe words, that
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hooker</hi> was in errour: was this a reproachfull upbraiding of him, while he ſpake but the truth? And as litle reproach was there in my ſpeech touching <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport.</hi> But had I ſpoken in the rude language of theſe complaynants, who (as I noted before) ſay of that writing which was framed for accommodation of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> and ſubſcribed firſt by 5. Miniſters, and after confirmed by the Claſſis, that they thinke no godly man will abſolutely be bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, this had bene indeed a reproachfull and unchriſtian cenſure, ſeeing many godly men have their errours, whereunto they ſuffer themſelves to be bound by an abſolute ſubſcription, and promiſe to obſerve and maintaine the ſame by a further degree of approbation, then was required of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, as for my promiſe, whereof they make a confuſed and unjuſt relation, thus it was. Having ſpoken in my Sermon of divers errours, and beſide others making ſpeciall mention of Arrians, that degrade the Sonne of God from his dignity; of Anabaptiſts that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade all infants from their dignity; of Browniſts who degrade ſuch infants from their dignity, whoſe parents are no members of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church with us, though otherwiſe of the ſame Religion and <pb n="117" facs="tcp:1262:65"/> profeſſion with us: hereupon for concluſion, I uttered theſe words verbatim, as of purpoſe I writ them downe before to prevent the perverting of them; viz.
<hi>of this errour of the Brownists I purpoſe (if the Lord permit) to ſpeake more hereafter, and ere long, when I come to that part of the Catechiſme that concernes the Baptiſme of infants.</hi> This was all the promiſe that I made in publick, of which there was ſo much exſpectation before hand, and ſo much talk after. Now had I ſpoken onely of the Browniſts errour about Baptiſme; yet had I fulfilled my word, that I ſpake in publike. But furthermore whereas upon occaſion I had elſwhere in private ſpoken to this purpoſe, that I would alſo deale againſt the opinion of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> in my Sermon at that time which I had nominated; this promiſe was alſo performed by me. For the opinion of
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> is or was (according to his owne words and writings) that Baptiſme is to be denyed to ſuch infants, whoſe parents being no members of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, did refuſe to ſubmit unto private examination, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they made publick profeſſion of fayth in anſwering to thoſe queſtions, demanded of them at the baptiſme of their children. Now againſt this opinion I dealt in every argument, that I brought againſt the opinion of the Anabaptiſts and Browniſts, and made expreſſe mention thereof, at leaſt 4 or 5 times; and beſides this, thoſe anſwers which I then gave to the ſeverall objections and allegations of the Browniſts, touching the baptiſme of theſe infants, were ſuch as did alſo ſerve to cleare the queſtion betwixt <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> and us, as may further appeare by the notes of my Sermon, which I then wrote more largely then at other times I was wont, fearing ſuch wrong as theſe complaynants doe unto me; and the teſtimony of others can likewiſe ſerve for confirmation hereof. And therefore moſt falſe and injurious is the aſſertion of theſe men, that complaine I avoyded the queſtion betweene us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whereas they tell of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenports</hi> offer unto me, to declare in publick, how far he differed from the Browniſts, it is true indeed, that upon my motion he made ſuch an offer, but therein he neither ſatisfyed my deſire, nor performed his owne promiſe, though he had time enough to have done it long before he left his publick preaching with us. And had he done this, and withall ſhewed his reaſons why he did ſo far differ, as he ſaith from the Browniſts in this point; had he reprooved and refuted their opinions, and <pb n="118" facs="tcp:1262:66"/> anſwered their objections, it would ſoone have appeared, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

For there is ſuch a neere affinity betwixt their opinions, that the errour of the Browniſts could not be refuted by him, but that his owne opinion muſt fall together. Their opinions are like twinnes that muſt live and dye together.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, for their exclamation, <hi>Is this brotherly dealing thus to uſe a Miniſter, who hath ſo lovingly aſſisted him and

                  <p n="3">3. After his deſiſtance from preaching, had he dealt faythfully &amp; ſincerely, as becommeth a Miniſter of Chriſt, it is not probable that this ſlanderous writing had ever bene made by theſe complaynants his eſpeciall friends, to the great diſturbance of our Church, and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of ſo many.</p>
                  <p>Neither helps it to ſay, he rebuked ſome of them privately, or that in <hi>Mr. Wh.</hi> his houſe, he preached againſt ſome that begun to ſchiſme: for their dealing began to be ſo groſſe and ſhamefull, that though there was no love of me yet if he loved himſelf and his owne credit, for the purging of himſelf, he muſt needes declare that he would not juſtify the dealing of ſome of theſe complaynants. Who knowes not that they which are of one confederacy, may ſometimes ſharply rebuke ſome of their confederates for their raſh and unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed proceedings in ſome particulars, and yet whet them &amp; ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then them in their oppoſition and contention otherwiſe, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their common opinions.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, it is not enough for theſe complaynants to burthen me with a falſe relation of things done, unleſſe they lay upon me alſo a burthen of falſe imaginations, touching my thoughts and intents, which they ſurmiſe againſt me, as though I had not onely done wrong, but <hi>all to the end to juſtify my keeping of him out of the Church;</hi> as if I had no other thought of preſerving the Church, and avoyding of ſcandall and faction, and doing right to the infants; but all for mine owne ends, as they ſpake before, all for carnall reſpects, without regard of truth or right, without conſcience of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and will of God.

                  <p>Seventhly, it is alſo falſe and maketh the heape of their falſe aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be the greater, when as they ſay of having
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport; which the Claſſis at firſt conſented unto, though they knew the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi> For when the Claſſis conſented, they knew no other, but that the difference was taken away, and that he conſented to the judgement and counſaile given him by writing, and that which we had done for his accommodation. When his conſent was teſtifyed and knowne, thereupon our Elderſhip reſolved for him; thereupon ſome Miniſters conſented to ſeeke approbation of the Magiſtrates; thereupon the Magiſtrates conſented, and thereupon the Claſſis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, not knowing that the difference remayned. And for the proofe hereof, there is teſtimony of Magiſtrates and Miniſters, of Claſſis and Elderſhip to confirme the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, they complaine that I brought the matter againe to the Claſſis <hi>by force.</hi> I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. How doe theſe complaynants know in what maner I brought this matter to the Claſſis? which of the Elders hath told them, or what other witneſſes have they of this <hi>force</hi> that was uſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The matter being formerly brought unto the Claſſis, that had given conſent for his calling: the eaſe ſo depending they ought in all reaſon to know the iſſue thereof.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That might rather have bene called an act of force and intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, if our Elderſhip without conſent of the Claſſis, ſhould have ſet up <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> for a lecturer or aſſiſtant.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> having contrary to exſpectation refuſed the calling, which was given unto him by conſent of the Claſſis, it was my duety to acquaint them therewith.

                  <p>Ninthly, where they ſay, that I brought the matter unto the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, <hi>to have them make an order to condemne their owne practiſe;</hi> I had not well underſtood the meaning, but that <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>; if it were unlike or unreaſonable that they ſhould make an order to condemne their owne practiſe, then is it not likely or reaſonable that they would allow us to make an order for condemning of their practiſe: Then alſo was it not reaſonable, that we in favour of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> ſhould make an order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our owne practiſe, and to juſtify the practiſe of the Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, to make the meaſure of their ſlanderous conceits yet the greater, <hi>they conceave that</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paget <hi>is the onely cauſe they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of ſuch heavenly meanes for their edification.</hi> To this I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ſpeciall cauſe that hath deprived them of
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> is <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenports</hi> owne denyall to adminiſter the Sacrament of Baptiſme, according to the order of theſe Churches; and if any of theſe complaynants, being of the ſame judgement, have confirmed <hi>Mr. Davenport</hi> in this opinion, then are they alſo cauſes of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation. And if <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> be of the ſame minde with theſe complaynants in this their writing, touching the undue power of the Claſſis, then is there much more cauſe in himſelfe, why they ſhould be deprived of him, leaſt he ſhould harden them in the conceit of that new forme of government, that appeares to be in their heads.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Seeing the Claſſis required of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> a conſent unto that adviſe given by writing unto him, which he refuſed; ſeeing the Magiſtrates alſo required our Elders to ſurceaſſe from ſeeking him, either as Paſtour or aſſiſtant: Seeing <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

If the liberty of the Church be thus loſt, then by their owne confeſſion, the authority of the Magiſtrates is to be ſought. Therefore they that have made this Proteſtation of their innocency, and of being wholly guiltles, even for their utmoſt endeavour for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe, is not juſt and upright.</p>

If his hand be with them in this buſines, it may ſooner defile himſelf, then make them guiltleſſe. But if they have not ſo much as his counſell and approbation, then where is their utmoſt endeavour, and where is that godly care that ought to have bene uſed for avoyding of offence?</p>

And therefore it is againſt all equity, that they ſhould ſo injuriouſly, ſo partially and ſo ingratefull deale with their friends, in placing them next unto me, as the cauſes of evill; when according to their opinion, others more blame worthy ſhould rather come betwixt.</p>
                  <p>From the matter of their <hi>PROTESTATION,</hi> come we now to conſider the forme of it. They <hi>protest before the Lord and his Church.</hi> A proteſtation is more then a ſimple affirmation, and more then an earneſt aſſeveration. In proteſtations witneſſes are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and called for; and the word which in Scripture is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tranſlated to proteſt, the very ſame is ſometimes alſo well tranſlated to<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>For the firſt witneſſe; To proteſt before the Lord, is more then common Proteſtations; to call him for a witneſſe in our proteſts, doth participate of the nature of an oath, in one ſpeciall part thereof. And hereby may appeare the fearfull ſinne of theſe preſumptuous Proteſtants, who call the Lord for a witneſſe of their double fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood; of their juſtification of themſelves as wholly guiltles; of their condemnation of me, as a principall and obſtinate offender, as

The Lord is witneſſe of every idle word, though he be not called for, but being called for a witneſſe in ſuch a bold Proteſtation, ſo voyd of truth, as if men would make the God of truth acceſſary unto their falſe aſſertions, this cannot but kindle the wrath of God, and his jealouſye againſt thoſe that doe ſo take his Reverend &amp; Glorious Name in vayne, neither will he hold them guiltleſſe, though they boaſtingly hold themſelves wholly guiltleſſe.<note place="margin">

                  <p n="2">2. This particular Church, whereof theſe men are members, doth not (ſo farre as I can diſcerne) juſtify their Proteſtation, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of theſe complaynants for their ſcandalous writing, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the government and doctrine taught by me in the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Even theſe complaynants being ſo different as is before noted, cannot be witneſſes for the truth of this proteſtation. Yea I aſſure my ſelfe, that if they were ſeverally examined, they neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood what they have ſubſcribed unto; neither yet would agree one with another, touching the meaning of theſe complaints. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though they have called Heaven and Earth to record againſt me, and for themſelves yet can they not be cleared by either of them in ſuch maner as they have proteſted. Their owne witneſſes are againſt themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Whereas in fine they tell the Elders, that <hi>they have the chiefeſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Church, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Elders that rule well, are worthy of double honour. Their principall dignity is to be examples of the flock in all godlines, and to uſe their power aright. But to exerciſe authority, according to the conceits of theſe men, noted in their complaints, in oppoſition unto the ſuperiour power, that is in Claſſes and Synods, the Elders might thereby juſtly make themſelves unworthy of any authority, honour or office at all in the Church of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Elders have the chiefeſt authority in the Church, how comes it to paſſe that ſome of theſe complaynants doe uſurpe and arrogate an authority above them, in preaching and expounding the Scriptures, ſo as theſe Elders dare not attempt?</p>

                  <p>IN the concluſion of theſe complaynants obſerve this heap of offences, partly in the writing, and partly in their deeds attending the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. After ſo many reproachfull complaints, to conclude and ſeale up all with ſuch a vehement Proteſtion, was a great boldnes in ſin.</p>

                     </gap>ent themſelves with words, but with pen and incke to write downe their reproaches, was another boldnes in evill-doing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. After writing to gather hands and ſubſcription of names, was a further ſtrengthening of themſelves in wrong-doing, &amp; a ſnare unto others.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To boaſt they could have done more; and in ſuch offence to pretend avoyding of offence as here they doe, is ſo much the more offenſive.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Beſides their owne writing, to require a publick record in the Regiſter of the Church, is a great inſolency.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Beſides publike record, to require a ſpace left for ſubſcription of more names, is a ſtrange impudency.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. To be ſo eager in the purſuit hereof, as 5 ſeverall times to come unto the Conſiſtory, in ſeeking to be regiſtred there, as was done by ſome of them, is a ſtrange importunity.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. To be thus importunate and urgent at ſuch time, when I was weake and ſickly that I could not come abroad, ſometimes to ſee what they did, was a great inhumanity.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. To leave their ſubſcribed complaints in the hands of ſuch as without their knowledge might either give copies thereof in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as was firſt done, or might alſo print the ſame, as now by one of them it is printed, this was a great unadviſednes, and folly in them.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. To take the name of God in vayne, by beſeeching the Lord to bleſſe theſe their unlawfull indeavours, (eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſome of them alſo had a remarkable day of faſting, and <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

                     <hi>to ſmite with the fiſt of wickednes, and to make their voyce to be heard on high,</hi>) this is more offenſive &amp; a juſt cauſe of new humiliation unto them.</p>
                  <p>Now if theſe complaynants had their deſire fulfilled, what els could be exſpected but faction and ſchiſme, and all maner of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Church? If their writing againſt me be recorded in the Regiſter of the Church, it is reaſon that my anſwer be recorded alſo. If their writing have names ſubſcribed, and place left for whoſoever will, to joyne their names with them; it is equall that under my anſwer a place be left alſo for whoſoever will to underwrite their <pb facs="tcp:1262:72"/> names therein. If any new members of the Church be taken on, the like liberty may as well be claymed by them, to ſubſcribe their names as they pleaſe, either in the one or other voyd place left for ſubſcription, &amp;c. But who ſees not what an intolerable and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious fancie theſe men have hatched in their braines?</p>
                  <p>This their practiſe repreſents unto us as in a glaſſe, the lively image of a deadly war, wherein the ordering of the battell is already thus deſcribed, or rather preſcribed by them:</p>
                  <p>The 9 firſt Subſcribers being more forward in ſeparating then the reſt, are not without reaſon ſet formoſt by themſelves, in the <hi>Vant-garde</hi> of this ſubſcription.</p>
                  <p>The other 12 that joyne in the complaint, but were not ſo haſty to leave communion in the Lords Supper, are placed in the
<hi>middle-ward,</hi> with ſome diſtinction after the former.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that come after, whoſe names they would have to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the empty ſpace, that is left for them in their deſire, they muſt then bring up the rere of this Army, and ſo make the
<hi>Rere-ward.</hi> Yea it is noted in the end of their printed booke, that now already,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>After theſe grievances were given unto the Conſiſtory, divers mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers more hearing thereof, deſired to joyne in the ſame, and ſubſcribed their names alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe unknowne adverſaries, whoſe names though they be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, are yet hidden from me, are like unto the troopes of reſerve, which for the preſent lurcke in ſecret and ly in ambuſcado, ready to break out, and to make an aſſault and to fall on, as opportunity ſhall ſerve.</p>
                  <p>This army of complaynants being thus ſet in aray, and armed for the battell, what contention and ſtrife; what ſcandall and offence doe they occaſion hereby? How ill doth it become theſe men with prayers and proteſtations, to require others to thinke upon ſome lawfull courſe to be taken for the redreſſe of evilles; and yet at the ſame time to deviſe and deſire, and that ſo importunately, ſuch an unlawfull, diſordred and dangerous courſe for the encreaſe of evills, as that the like at any time hath ſcarſely bene heard of? The lawfull courſe for redreſſe of evilles, is that plaine high-way, and that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooved order, wherein we are eſtabliſhed with theſe Reformed Churches, namely if any be wronged or unſatisfyed in the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to goe for refuge unto the Claſſis, and from thence, if need be, <pb n="132" facs="tcp:1262:73"/> to the Synod; unleſſe by the Word of God this way be prooved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, for all the evident wrongs, which theſe complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants have done unto me, how many and how great ſo ever they be; though they have ſought to blot my name with reproach; though their complaints be now recorded, and their names regiſtred in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred of
<hi>W. B.</hi> his books; yet my prayer unto God for them is, that their offence herein may be blotted out of that record &amp; booke of remembrance that lyeth open before the Lord, and that by their unfeigned repentance, they obtaine grace and favour from God.</p>
                  <p>And as for me, my hope and confidence is in the Lord, who through his rich grace hath covered all mine iniquities in Chriſt; and notwithſtanding theſe accuſations, in the middes of my weaknes, I can truely ſay with his reproached ſervants, according to the meaſure of the gift of God,<note place="margin">

                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>FIrſt, by what right <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> himſelf being no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our Church, did communicate with us in the Lords Supper, by the ſame right may the Paſtour of any particular Church upon occaſion exerciſe his miniſtery in ſome act thereof, towards thoſe who are no members of his Church. Had <hi>Mr. Davenport</hi> looked well upon himſelf and his owne practiſe, he might have found reaſon to bethinke himſelf better, unleſſe he think that I was not bound to exerciſe any act of my miniſtery towards him, when as he deſired the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſuppoſe Paul in the place alledged had required no more of the Paſtours of Epheſus, then that which <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> intendeth, yet might a further duety have bene layd upon them in ſome other place of Scripture. It is no good kinde of diſputing, to argue thus, No more is required of Miniſters in ſuch and ſuch a place, therefore in no other place at all.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and more particularly, whereas the ſolemne preaching of the Goſpell with publick invocation of the name of God, are mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall actes; ſeeing Paſtours and teachers, the maydens of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <pb n="134" facs="tcp:1262:74"/> are not onely bound to admit, but alſo to invite and call others even thoſe that are without, Heathens, Turks or Iewes, underſtanding the language to come and heare them, thereby to pluck them out of the pit of deſtruction, <hi>Prov. 9.3.4.5. Mat. 28.19.20.</hi> Therefore are they bound to exerciſe ſome acts of their miniſtery towards thoſe who are no members of their Church.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, for the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, it is alſo a duety of the miniſtery, to be performed by a Paſtour to more then the members of his particular congregation: and this not onely by admiſſion of the particular members of an other Church to receave the Lords Supper with them in their Church upon occaſion, which the<note n="*" place="margin">See Arrow against ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par. p. <hi>96. 97.</hi>
                     </note> Browniſts themſelves doe allow; but alſo when need requires to adminiſter the Sacraments, both of Baptiſme and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in neighbour Churches that are deſtitute, being required there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. This I have<note n="*" place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>17.

                     </note> heretofore already prooved againſt <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworth;</hi> and it is the errour of thoſe Separatiſts, to deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of ſuch help. Hereupon it followed, that after the death of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ainſworth</hi> for many yeares together, they were without Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and had neither Lords Supper nor Baptiſme adminiſtred in their Church, their children for many yeares remayning unbaptiſed, and ſundry dying unbaptiſed: for which neglect and delay of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, they had juſt cauſe to feare that the Lord might have met them,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.24.</note> as he did Moſes in the Inne, for neglecting to circumciſe his ſon.</p>
                  <p>And it is obſervable how <hi>Mr. Davenport</hi> ſtumbleth at the ſame ſtone, and miſalledgeth the very ſame place of Scripture,
<hi>Act. 20.28.</hi> as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ainſworth</hi> had done before to the ſame purpoſe, to reſtraine Paſtours from executing any duety or act of their miniſtery towards ſuch as are no members of their owne particular congregation.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, for the government of the Church, and for adminiſtration of diſcipline, which is an other work of the miniſtery; this alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vnto Paſtours, not onely for the members of the particular Church ſpecially committed unto them, but for the members of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other particular congregations combined in Claſſes and Synods, where the cauſes and controverſies of many people are decided and determined by the joynt authority of many Miniſters, meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for that end, as we ſee in that exemple, <hi>Act. 15.2. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, to come neerer unto this place <hi>Act. 20.28.</hi> men doe then <pb n="135" facs="tcp:1262:74"/> attend unto their owne flock, whereof the H. Ghoſt hath made them overſeers, when they labour that their flock may be encreaſed, that more ſoules may dayly be added to the flock, and that the number of the faithfull may grow; for thereby the mutuall edification, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſpirituall joy of all is encreaſed, according to that bleſſing that is oft noted in the<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſa.</hi> 49.20.21.
<hi>Act.</hi> 4.4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.14.</note> Scriptures. This bleſſing is obteyned by the labours of faithfull Miniſters, with thoſe which at firſt are no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, in ſeeking to bring them into the fold. And thus the Paſtours of Epheſus living among the great multitude of infidels and heathniſh Idolatours in that City, had not attended unto the flock committed unto them, unleſſe they had laboured to encreaſe their flock by their labours towards thoſe Epheſians that were without.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, men doe then attend unto their owne flock, when they labour that the ſame may be preſerved in the truth, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt the manifold and dangerous errours, ſuch as the Paſtours of Epheſus were warned of <hi>Act. 20.29.30.</hi> In ſuch dangers if either the faithfull Paſtours were taken away by death; or if through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of gifts they were not able to ſtop the mouthes of adverſaries, what remained then to be done,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25.26.27.</note> but to ſeek the help of neighbour Miniſters for their aſſiſtance, the Lord requiring that members of the body of Chriſt, ſhould take care of one an other in their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities to help them? Now this convincing of erroneous perſons ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially in the Church, being a miniſteriall duety, <hi>Tit.
1.9.10.11. 1. Tim. 5.20.</hi> it followes that upon the performance hereof in ſuch caſes, men may exerciſe ſome acts of their miniſtery towards ſuch as are no members of their owne particular congregation.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, whereas <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> doth afterwards acknowledge, that <hi>in regard of the communion of particular Churches amongst themſelves, he neither did nor doth refuſe to baptiſe their infants, who are not members of this Church: ſo that he may be ſatisfyed by ſome precedent examination, if otherwiſe they be unknowne unto him, that they are Christians indeed:</hi> hereby he doth plainely refute himſelf, and that divers wayes; for, 1. If the communion of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches amongſt themſelves doe warrant him to baptiſe their infants, who are no members of his Church, then is it an errour to thinke that a Paſtour may not exerciſe his miniſtery in ſome act of it, toward thoſe who are no members of his Church; and all his alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations <pb facs="tcp:1262:75"/> to that and are vaine and idle.
2. How vaine is it to call into queſtion, whether they be Chriſtians indeed, viz. in regard of their externall profeſſion, who are confeſſed to be members of an other true Chriſtian Church, that is in communion with us? 3. Seeing M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Davenport</hi> profeſſeth, that <hi>he neither did nor doth deny to baptiſe their infants who are members of this Church,</hi> what reaſon hath he to require a precedent examination of the members of an other Church more then of the members of this Church? If the members of this Church may be baptiſed upon this warrant, becauſe they are members of it, why may not the members of an other true Church be alſo baptiſed upon the ſame ground? 4. Why doth <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> onely mention his regard of the communion of particular Churches amongſt themſelves for baptiſing their infants? Why doth he not as well regard the communion of particular perſons, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If he doe it by vertue of that communion, which is betwixt particular Churches, when as he himſelf is no Miniſter of any particular Church, how much more may they that are eſtabliſhed Miniſters, performe ſome acts of their miniſtery to thoſe that are no members of their Churches, when as upon occaſion they are required ſo to doe? If he doe it not as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40.</note> nor countes it any Miniſteriall act, but doth it as a Prophet, and as in an exerciſe of propheſy, yet ſeeing this alſo ought not to be done, but according to order, and not without conſent of ſuch as have authority to diſpoſe and governe ſuch actions; if now their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, requeſt or allowance can warrant him to doe that which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would be unlawfull, why may not alſo the requeſt of the ſame perſons warrant him that is an eſtabliſhed Miniſter to performe ſome Miniſteriall act in a neighbour Church, or to ſome members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, though otherwiſe unlawfull, if he were not ſo required? Or if he have any other ground whereon he reſteth, the knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration thereof might happily give ſome further light unto this controverſy.</p>

                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THe Apoſtle here ſpeakes of doubting about things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as the uſe of meates and obſervation of dayes, Rom. 14.2-6. which obſervation doth not commend us to God; ſeeing neither they that did eat were the better, nor they that eat not, were the worſe, <hi>1. Cor.
8.8.</hi> The kingdome of God conſiſted not in ſuch things, <hi>Rom.
14.17.</hi> But the matter in controverſy betwixt us, is neither in it ſelf, nor in the eſtimation of either part, a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. You judge it a ſin to baptiſe the infants of ſuch parents; we judge it a ſin to deny baptiſme unto them. Therefore though the Apoſtle doe allow a toleration of things indifferent, this is no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for toleration of that which is held ſinfull and ſimply unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle here ſpeaks of ſuch a toleration, whereby men were receaved as brethren and members of Chriſt, ſuch as might be ſaved, being receaved of God, <hi>Rom. 14.3.</hi> Our queſtion is not of ſuch receaving, but of receaving to an office and publick miniſtery with us in the Church. Now many may be receaved for Chriſtians, which can not lawfully be admitted for Miniſters, in regard of their diſſention and differences from the Church of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The doubting and wavering in matters of Religion, being a diſtraction and ſuſpenſion of the mind betwixt truth and errour, and being repugnant to faith, is a very dangerous and great evill to be taken heed of. It brings men oftentimes into a very miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and to a neceſſity of ſinning to their great woe and hurt: for in many dueties that are to be done, the doubting perſon is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; ſinneth, whether he doe them or doe them not. For example, it being a duety to heare the word of God in true Churches; he that begins to decline unto ſchiſme and doubts, it is a ſin, that perſon ſins
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1262:77"/> both wayes; If he

                     </gap>tingly, it is a ſin not being of faith, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. If he refuſe to heare, it is a ſin and ſchiſme, condemned <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. in forſaking the aſſembly of the Saint. So for one declining to Anabaptiſme, doubting whether his child ſhould be baptiſed or not: If he bring it to baptiſme doubtingly, it is a ſin for want of faith. If he refuſe to bring it, he ſins many wayes againſt his child, and againſt the Church of God. And ſo in many other caſes. Therefore let men take heed, how they excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their doubting, and how they pleaſe themſelves therein.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport,</hi> ſeeing he heard of our controverſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his coming over the Seas unto us, and of this particular about baptiſme, if he doubted hereof, and could not ſatisfy his conſcience, that it was lawfull for him to joyne with us in the baptiſing of ſuch infants as we ſpeak of; then ought he rather not to have offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto us, to diſturbe our Churches peace by the doubts which he brought with him, and by the contentions likely to ariſe thereupon. Then might our Church have bene edifyed by the more ſpeedy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ſome other faithfull Miniſter, who being free from this doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and irreſolution of mind, could then have better accorded with vs.</p>

How can it be prooved from hence that ſuch as conſented unto the doctrine of the Goſpell propounded unto them, by anſwering <hi>Yea</hi> unto it, and bowing their heads or bodies, in teſtimony of their approbation and liking thereof, might not thereupon be admitted unto baptiſme both they and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants?</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. when as in old time circumciſed parents brought their infants to be circumciſed alſo, it cannot thence be ſhewed, that more queſtions were propounded in the examination of them, then are now in the adminiſtration of Baptiſme propounded unto ſuch baptiſed parents, as doe now bring their children to be baptiſed: or that the children of ſuch had circumciſion denyed unto them, who ſhewed their conſent and willingnes in embracing the covenant, by ſuch brief anſwers and geſtures as we ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. Abraham is there called <hi>the father of all them that beleeve,</hi> whether they were members of a particular viſible Church or not. And for ought we finde in the holy ſtory, there might be ſome beleevers even in Abrahams owne time, that were neither members of Abraams family, nor yet under the government or guidance of any particular Church. If a ſon or bond-ſervant of Ephron the Hittite, or of any other Amorite or Canaanite were then brought unto the knowledge of the true God, and to wait for the promiſe, why might not the infant of ſuch an one have then bene cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, though not living in a viſible Church?</p>

                  <p>THe words of the Apoſtle here alledged are theſe, <hi>For what have I to doe to judge them alſo that are without? doe ye not judge them that are within?</hi> How <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> applyes this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to the queſtion in hand, it is not plainely deſcribed by him. It had bene good, if he had ſhewed how he had drawen his argument from hence, that the anſwer might have bene framed accordingly. In the meane time let this ſuffice for anſwer unto that which is obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly objected from this place:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of 3 ſorts of perſons, which may be ſayd to be
<hi>without,</hi> thoſe offer themſelves firſt unto our conſideration, that being members of a viſible Church, are yet without true faith, and therefore are no members of the inviſible Church: Of ſuch Chriſt ſpeaketh, <hi>unto them that are without, all things are done in parables,</hi> Mark. 4.11. But ſuch the Apoſtle in this place doth not ſpeak of: for ſuch being in regard of their externall profeſſion within the Covenant, and within the viſible Church, might be judged by the ſame, and cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as occaſion required. Such were many in Iſraël, and are in other Chriſtian Churches.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe in ſpeciall are <hi>without,</hi> that are no way Chriſtians, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in deed nor in profeſſion; ſuch as were the open Infidelles and Heathens that lived in Corinth, of ſuch it is ſayd,
<hi>Walk honestly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them without,</hi> 1. Theſſ. 4.12. Theſe though they were jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the word preached, when ſometimes they heard it,
1. Cor. 14.24. or by the admonitions and examples of the godly whom they deſpiſed, Gen. 19.7.9. Heb. 11.7. yet before they ſubmitted themſelves unto the Church, were not to be judged and cenſured by Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, nor to be avoyded as excommunicates, for then muſt men goe out of the world, as the Apoſtle here ſhewes, 1. Cor. 5.10.12.</p>

Theſe parents, though in regard of that Church where they receaved their owne baptiſme, and in regard of that Church whereunto they bring their infants to be baptiſed, they profeſſe and practiſe ſome imperfect communion therewith, and therefore in ſome ſenſe may be ſayd to be of ſuch Churches; yet becauſe for the preſent they live not within the pale of any Eccleſiaſticall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, neither are ſubject unto the diſcipline, either of one or other Church, in this regard are ſuch here commonly ſayd to be without. Now how <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> will deduct and infer from the place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that theſe kinde of parents are not to have the priviledge of Chriſtians, ſo far that their infants may be baptiſed, that cannot I comprehend: this remaynes to be manifeſted by him.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe onely, according to the order of theſe Reformed Churches, are admitted for complete members of the Church, who bringing teſtimony of their good converſation, after examination and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their agreement with us in the ſame faith and Religion, and after ſolemne covenant and promiſe of ſubmiſſion unto that diſcipline and government exerciſed amongſt them, have their names publiſhed before the whole congregation the Lords-day following, and when no juſt exception comes againſt them, are then receyved and confirmed for members of ſuch particular Churches. But that the Children of theſe onely are to be baptiſed, that is not made to appeare from the ſentence of Paul 1. Cor.
5.12.</p>
                  <p>For this third ſort of perſons <hi>without,</hi> though their fault be great in not joyning unto ſome particular Church, when opportunity per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits; though ſome through ignorance and errour, and ſome for their carnall caſe and other ſiniſter reſpects, doe abſteyne from joyning themſelves unto the Church: yet even among theſe alſo ſome have more knowledge of the truth, and are more frequent in attending upon the publick worſhip of God, and are otherwiſe more unbla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable in their converſation, then ſome of thoſe that are members of <pb facs="tcp:1262:80"/>

<hi>Davenport</hi> alledgeth for himſelfe the conſent of Divines of the Dutch Churches in their Confeſſions, and of all Reformed Churches in the harmony of their Confeſſions, and further he ſayth, <hi>to conclude, all Divines agree in this.</hi> Now although there be a great deale of vaine confidence and mis-taking in him to apply the teſtimonies of learned men to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of his opinion, wherein he diſſenteth from vs; yet is not my purpoſe for this preſent to enter into a diſpute about the divers judgements of learned men concerning this queſtion. It ſhall ſuffice for this time to have anſwered that which he now objecteth from the Scripture; I being but defendant, and he opponent.

Yet as occaſion ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire (if the Lord permit and aſſiſt) my purpoſe alſo is, to adde ſomething more according to my weaknes, for the clearing of this point, hoping that ſome other more able will be ſtirred up hereby, to make a more full defence of the truth.</p>

            <p>UPon the comming forth of the Book of Complaints againſt me,
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

            <p>The ſumme of his threefold Proteſtation is; 1. <hi>That he knew not the Publiſher; 2. that he gave no conſent to this Publiſhing of it; 3. that the Publiſher to make ſatisfaction for his great injury, ought either to revoke his bookes and burne the whole impreſſion, or print an other for the publick acknowledgment of his fault therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For theſe 3 Proteſtations: 1. There be divers reaſons why men ſhould beleeve <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> herein; and therefore doe I alſo give credit unto him in ech of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Could he alſo have made Proteſtation, that he had not firſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out theſe things by writing, and ſo filled the hand of him that publiſhed them againe in print, it had bene more honour to him, and more peace to our Church.</p>

            <p>Touching this threefold confeſſion or profeſſion, obſerve 1. The complaints of <hi>Mr. Davenport,</hi> touching ſuch injurious reports as are by him mentioned in his writing, are already ſhewed to be unjuſt.</p>

And even herein this part of his Proteſtation, doth he not ſhew his intent was to ſatisfy <hi>the Dutch in that City,</hi> viz. of Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <hi>and ſome of the members of that Church, and many of our nation in other parts of theſe Countries,</hi> who (as he ſaith) he was informed, that they were <hi>by mis-reports prejudiced againſt him?</hi> Doth not this alſo accord with the practiſe of his ſpeciall freind the Publiſher, who hath alſo cauſed this writing to be tranſlated into Dutch for their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction? Could all this be done, and not be counted a publick work?

               </gap> with ſuch ſtore of complaints as he did.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For being <hi>a buiſy body, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> aſkes the Publiſher, <hi>what calling he hath to interpoſe himſelf thus publickly, &amp;c.</hi> And yet who more then <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> hath given him a calling (ſuch an one as it is) to interpoſe himſelf in ſpreading abroad the writing, which he communicated unto his two <hi>buiſy bodies,</hi> to the end they might upon occaſion divulge the ſame? Yea in this very <hi>Quaere</hi> doth not <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> give a kind of warrant for publiſhing theſe complaints, brought to the Conſiſtory, when as he diſallowes the publiſhing thereof, with this limitation onely,
<hi>before matters have bene there diſcuſsed &amp; determined, or at leaſt, before the iſsue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, which there ſhall be put to the question, hath bene ſufficiently demanded and exspected.</hi> Doth not this imply, that though not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet after this done, there would be a warrant to publiſh theſe matters? And ſeeing the complaynants have bene ſo importunate in their demandes about this buſines, as is before ſhewed, and think they have exſpected and waited long enough; what wonder if ſuch a ſpeech as this, ſhould make them conceave that they had now ſome warrant to publiſh their complaints unto the world? And further howſoever the matters publiſhed, doe not <hi>onely concerne</hi> our Church, and the ſpeciall things conteyned in theſe complaints, have bene already judged and determined by the Claſſis; yet ſeeing <hi>Mr. Davenport</hi> hath bene an inſtrument to publiſh ſome of them by writing, no marvell if this Publiſher thought that the example of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenport</hi> was ſome warrant unto him to publiſh them in print alſo.</p>
            <p>HIs threefold Requeſt is, 1. To me, that I <hi>would rest ſatisfyed with his ingenuous profeſſion in this particular, &amp;c.</hi>
2. To the Publiſher, that he would <hi>affix this ſheet of paper</hi> [his Proteſtation] <hi>in ſtead of a Poſtſcript to his book, or disperſe it among all perſons to whoſe hands his book ſhall come, or is come, &amp;c. or make one good fire of both.</hi> 3. To all men to whoſe hands the other book ſhall come, that <hi>they will ſpeedily ſend this after it, or ſtich this with it, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching his Requeſt to me, I doe willingly yeeld thereunto, and doe reſt ſatisfyed for this particular, that he knew not of the printing

            <p n="2">2. By intimating further matter that he hath in ſtore beſide that which he hath already written againſt me, when as he telles how
<hi>he concealed other things which he might have added for his further clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, unleſſe more publick provocation ſhould make it neceſsary to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh all together, which he hath hitherto forborne.</hi> A threatning inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation like unto that which is in his preamble to his letter unto the Claſſis, and like unto thoſe that have elſwhere bene uttered by him.</p>
